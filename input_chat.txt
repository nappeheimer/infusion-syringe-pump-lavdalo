[09/01/26, 5:52:44 AM] ~ raghav: Here are the teams that have qualified for AmProAm'26. The scores were very close between a lot of teams, but due to a very high number of faccha reges and low senior reges only some teams could qualify. For those who didn't qualify, don't be disheartened, show up for the tournament to spectate or judge (like a lot of your seniors did last year), and fingers crossed for the rest of the tournaments this year.

[10/01/26, 3:06:34 PM] ~ Udit: Yeh toh bt hai
[10/01/26, 3:06:56 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: if the debate is about what YOU as a person should do, is it fair to also give the emotional aspect of the motion equal importance as the logical aspect of it.
[10/01/26, 3:07:44 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: Like something might logically be the better option but as humans it is less likely we think completely logicall
[10/01/26, 3:09:51 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: And if the debate is about something objectively wrong how to defend that, like how to sideline that in the arguement
[10/01/26, 3:10:14 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: asking in context of motion 3 yesterday
[10/01/26, 3:11:25 PM] ~ Charchit Agarwal: Yes exactly 
The 24 hour window for the pill seemed like something that could've been taken advantage of if we potray the actor as emotionally driven
[10/01/26, 3:12:07 PM] ~ raghav: Im not exactly sure as to what youre asking, but actor motions are about harms and benefits to the actor. They can obviously feel emptional benefits or emotional harms as well, and you have characterise what certain things affect them and how
[10/01/26, 3:12:15 PM] ~ raghav: If you be a little specific I can help more
[10/01/26, 3:13:49 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: Ig they are asking about should they consider the impulsiveness of the actor of making that decision??
[10/01/26, 3:13:50 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: If yes then no you should not
[10/01/26, 3:14:14 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: That's a whole other motion type
[10/01/26, 3:14:20 PM] ~ raghav: You cant consider what the actor is likely to do
[10/01/26, 3:14:25 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: One which is v underrated and underrepresented
[10/01/26, 3:14:29 PM] ~ Shrenik: The debate is not what the actor is likely to do but it is what the actor should do given the harms and benefits they incur
[10/01/26, 3:14:39 PM] ~ raghav: It will be represented soon dont worry
[10/01/26, 3:14:49 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: Lessgooo
[10/01/26, 3:15:19 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: Inrounds mein hi daaldena
[10/01/26, 3:15:25 PM] ~ Shrenik: There is no such thing as objective wrong
[10/01/26, 3:15:48 PM] ~ Shrenik: Today is the last inround i judge lol 😂
[10/01/26, 3:16:20 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: Like i was gov in yesterdays motion and my arguement had a lot of emotional points of how i should be giving the person a benefit of the doubt and that not taking the pill will cause more problems than taking it for all the stakeholders, and the opp speech was more pessimistic and logical and questioned the entire relationship as a whole, and in the adj speech i was told that out of emotional and logical arguements, logical ones take precedence. and i just thoguht maybe in actors debates it shuld also be taken into account what a person who has spent 10 years with a person he loves would and should do in that situation
[10/01/26, 3:16:48 PM] ~ Shlesha Gupta: not importantly , even if the actor is emotionally driven they would be even more desperate to talk to their partner about this fact rather than just taking the pill and letting it go, secondly we should consider that the partner is already 33 years of age and has enough emotional maturity to take rational decisions upon facts that are largly impacting their lives
[10/01/26, 3:17:17 PM] ~ Harshit Garg: Deb talks
[10/01/26, 3:17:38 PM] ~ Abhimanyu: The gov and opp clashing!!
[10/01/26, 3:17:40 PM] ~ raghav: first of all the adj should not that say, by default none of these arguments take precedence. and youre correct in claiming what you are. in a good debate you should ideally give something about what should be considered more important for the actor and why, the emotional reasons or the logical ones
[10/01/26, 3:17:52 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: ++ but if you think you cannot rebut their harms then either attack the premise and say ye pan out hona kyun probable nhi hai yaa outweigh your benefits say that sure kuch wrong hai but right outweighs the wrong
[10/01/26, 3:18:28 PM] ~ raghav: I think the adj meant to say since it was unclear which of these take precedence, logic is more persuasive to him
[10/01/26, 3:18:32 PM] ~ raghav: intuitivey
[10/01/26, 3:19:18 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: yeah i think he said this sorry
[10/01/26, 3:19:39 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: okay...
[10/01/26, 3:19:40 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: Fr that's why weighing is important... If you cannot say why emotional arguments should take precedence over logical ones you leave it over to the adj to decide that allowing biases to seep in
[10/01/26, 3:19:58 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: i think i did this during my DPM speech but maybe it was not very clear..
[10/01/26, 3:20:23 PM] ~ Shrenik: Its difficult to do bud dw
[10/01/26, 3:20:38 PM] ~ Shrenik: With time ho jaaegaa after numerous relationship debates
[10/01/26, 3:20:55 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: i tried doing that by considering the human factor in this arguement, about how saving the relatioship shoudl take precendence
[10/01/26, 3:21:38 PM] ~ Rahul Athipatla: Fr used to hate them still hate them
[10/01/26, 3:22:38 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: like, when questioned about if love even exists in the relationship, how do i defend that 
i tried saying that since the relatiobship has lasted 9+ years and is healthy and we know for sure no other accounts of infidelity have occured it is reasonavle to assume that the person has matured since then and has learnt from their mistakes and they love each other
[10/01/26, 3:22:59 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: but yeah like saying they havent cheated again doesnt really prove anythign cuz thats like expected of them
[10/01/26, 3:23:09 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: but i really dont know what else i can say 🥲🥲
[10/01/26, 3:28:59 PM] ~ Shrenik: Hmm generic incentive structures help
[10/01/26, 3:29:23 PM] ~ Shrenik: And like what ppl generally look for in relationships and how that guides their behaviours
[10/01/26, 3:29:44 PM] ~ Shrenik: In these motions covering bases with minimum assumptions is imp
[10/01/26, 3:35:54 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: like yeah i tried to by saying they coudlve ended it right after cheating and confessing to me, and wouldnt lose too much and could date someone else, because they would prefer dating someone who they havent cheated on right? but they didnt so i tried saying that they mustve  truly loved me, which is why they probably didnt confess out of fear of losing them…
[10/01/26, 3:36:01 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: but yeah ig its a pretty weak arguement

[11/01/26, 2:13:55 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: What's the issue?
[11/01/26, 2:13:58 PM] ~ Udit: Sahi hai
[11/01/26, 2:14:23 PM] ~ +: ur just showing them a new perspective how is giving them new knowledge forcing a choice
[11/01/26, 2:14:39 PM] ~ Tara Dhondiyal: the new perspective is new knowledge
[11/01/26, 2:14:53 PM] ~ Udit: Forced coercion under the guise of vr hai people shuld have free agency to do what they want to do
[11/01/26, 2:15:04 PM] ~ +: yeh but having new knowledge that is true is not propoganda or thought control
[11/01/26, 2:15:26 PM] ~ Udit: But its forced
[11/01/26, 2:15:32 PM] ~ +: they still would have free choice even with new knowledge
[11/01/26, 2:16:04 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: Matlab mujhe yeh weird laga the pain would be less in VR. Animals go through all sorts of psychological torture, etc which would be disproportionately more for humans. In a way government literally misinform kar rha hai logo ko. Plus no way humans can cope with what average factory farmed chicken goes through for a month
[11/01/26, 2:16:15 PM] ~ +: VR?
[11/01/26, 2:16:33 PM] ~ +: oh virtual reality
[11/01/26, 2:17:29 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: Government is torturing people to misinform them to achieve something they can achieve directly with the same fiat
[11/01/26, 2:17:35 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: Is what I feel
[11/01/26, 2:18:05 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: Plus torture never ends till every factory farm ends in the world, toh USA ke log suffer because of a random farm in nigeria ‎<This message was edited>
[11/01/26, 2:18:09 PM] ~ +: i mean creating laws directly to ban rearing would be the real forcing of choice i think
[11/01/26, 2:18:44 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: Haan but that's why I said same fiat. Both are forced policies
[11/01/26, 2:19:05 PM] ~ Harshit Garg: R3 ka adj feedback nhi show hora @CAP
[11/01/26, 2:19:31 PM] Sai Anish Reddy: Yepp
[11/01/26, 2:21:13 PM] ~ +: i mean if ur already classifying animal farm life as torture, just means u can tolerate animals suffering but not humans so ur just making an uniformed conscious choice to let them be tortured
[11/01/26, 2:22:11 PM] ~ +: 😂😂
[11/01/26, 2:22:13 PM] ~ +: ye kya h

[11/01/26, 2:22:32 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: Haan no i agree. But again, punishment is disproportionate. Anyway people let factory farming happen because they don't think animals have same capacity for pain. It's not that they don't agree that jo ho rha hai woh shi hai. This just adds to it ‎<This message was edited>

[14/01/26, 11:13:47 PM] ~ Kishore A: Children have been one if the most important issue for globally, from the orphaned ones in Israel, the abandoned ones in China due to their one-child policy and more.
Countries currently voluntarily fund orphanges in such poorer nations for the welfare of these children but often this isn't enough.
Export-orphanage is a newly proposed social policy to rehabilitate orphaned children in nations with poorly funded government to orphanges in western countries.

Assuming global enforcement is possible, THW implement the export-orphanages policy

[14/01/26, 11:18:33 PM] ~ Kishore A: Maria is a well-off late 30 year old living in Delhi. Her husband John, with string of 2 broken marriages before, was a bank employee. They had fallen in love and tied the knot after meeting at a party 5 years ago. Since about 3 months ago, their marriage took a turn. John has begun to gradually come home late, go out at odd hours, and gives unsatisfactory explanations for these where he's been. Listening to her friends suspicions of an affair, Maria checked John's phone but couldn't find anything. Her friends tell her to leave him as her parents have left her enough to live comfortably but she doesn't want to let go of her love without knowing more.

TH, as Maria, would heavily invest in reviving her marriage ‎<This message was edited>

Has it ever felt like you know one bench is winning over the other, but you just don’t know how to explain the reasoning behind it? or what metrics to compare all the 6 combinations of benches on? or even if you are not really interested in adjing but want to grow as a debater and want exposure to this format, this workshop is for you!!

PS: With a lot of BP externals this sem and Perspective PD (our very own internal BPD comp) not being even a month away, attending this workshop is highly encouraged.
Hoping to see y’all turn out🤗 ‎<This message was edited>

[15/01/26, 11:28:58 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: Our cg said this
[15/01/26, 11:31:34 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: We argue frame of morality is wrong in internal thinking, it's irrational and flawed and not representative of the point of morality which is to create a habitable society
[15/01/26, 11:32:39 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: i.e. laws are passed with respect to the frame of "this will do more good than harm" and logo ki internal voice is just disgust and selfishness. Outloud they argue w.r.t more good than harm frame, which is the right frame ‎<This message was edited>

[15/01/26, 11:39:08 PM] ~ +: i mean ha to ur saying arbitrarily that good and harm analysis is correct frame and not pure intuitive sense of justice that people hold
[15/01/26, 11:40:16 PM] ~ Tejaswa Mehra: Yes sort of. Morality born kis purpose se hui thi etc
[15/01/26, 11:43:22 PM] ~ +: i mean you could argue biological imperative sense that morality evolved as a mechanism to run our social structures so our intuitive sense of justice should prevail over a harm and good analysis which has classis counterarguments but is also mostly arbitrary
