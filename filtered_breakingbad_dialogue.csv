SKYLER,"I’m so sorry, you gave me and that time off and I really should have --"
GUS,You don’t think you’re ready now?
SKYLER,Okay.
SKYLER,"Walt, the MasterCard’s the one we don’t use."
WALT,"He’s out of the picture.  I saved his life -- I owed him that.  But now he and I are done.  Which is exactly what you wanted, isn’t it?"
JESSE,"Every cent he earns, every cent his wife earns, is mine.  Any place he goes, anywhere he turns, I’m gonna be there, grabbing my share.  He’ll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana for pennies, and I’ll be standing over him to get my cut.  He’ll see me when he wakes up in the morning, and when he crawls to sleep in whatever rat hole’s left for him after I shred his house down.  I will haunt his crusty ass forever, until the day he sticks a gun up his mouth and pulls the trigger just to get me out of his head. That’s what happens next."
WALT,Nothing.  I’m fine.
WALT,Really?
SKYLER,Get.  Out.
JESSE,"You ever have like, a wild animal trapped in your house?"
JESSE,... Nothing.
SAUL,You really think he’s serious?
SKYLER,"I just don’t know what the hell I’m doing anymore, y’know?"
HANK,Do I have to be there?
HANK,"Hi there.  Uh, Mrs. Ortega?"
JESSE,Yeah.
JESSE,"Point one-four, that’s like..? What does that --"
MARIE,I’ll go find somebody.
JESSE,How long you think you’ve got?
HANK,I made the mistake of watching “Jeopardy” with this dude one time.
SKYLER,Don’t tell me Amir’s sending you home at five now.
JESSE,Right.  That’s why.
HANK,"Now, I only ask this because I’m... I’m at a, you know, a dead-end here, potentially.  Uh, I’m working a case, and, uh..."
MARIE,"Well, Flynn looks like he can hold down the fort.  How ‘bout we go in your office."
HANK,"Meth labs are nasty on a good day -- but when you mix that stuff wrong, you wind up with mustard gas."
WALT,"Five nights a week, with two hours’ notice."
WALT,"I’ll do it.  I’m gonna need your help.  I mean, they’re watching me day and night.  They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment. Hell, I don’t even know where the man lives.  He’s not in the phone book, I can’t find him on the Internet."
SKYLER,Walt..?
JESSE,Mr. White..?
WALT,How many bedrooms?
WALT,O teklaiy.meAwrehyy?ou a t going to
MARIE,Who is the best physical therapist that you know?
MARIE,"So, it’s a mid-life crisis."
WALT,Help me how?
JESSE,"It’s, uh... oh!  Right there. Look.  Look!"
SKYLER,"Um, we’re thinking maybe a car wash."
WALT,"Amir, no.  We talked about this. Inside only.  And only till six."
WALT JR,I’m taking the bus.
HANK,"What, you want me to beg?"
JESSE,I’m so close.
SKYLER,"We need help right now, and Elliott can help us.  That money is nothing to him.  Why in the world would you not take it?"
JESSE,Acting like some skippy little bitch.  Like this is fun and games. This shit is shit you take -- serious.
MARIE,I say it will.
MARIE,...o-okay.
JESSE,"Duh!  Yeah, like I’m an idiot."
JESSE,What about the crap that gets left behind?
SKYLER,"Wow, look at the size of this basket.  It’s got so many goodies in it!  Look.  Chocolate-covered pretzels and, uh, cheese sticks and some fancy designer olives..."
WALT JR,Why you gotta treat him like this?
SKYLER,You killed him.
WALT,"Well... I, uh, I think he gets it, don’t you?  I mean, I... I think he saw it coming.  He sees your unhappiness, and..."
SKYLER,I’m here to talk about Hank.  You know what’s gonna happen to him if this Pinkman presses charges.
SAUL,#NAME?
GUS,What is Option B?
MARIE,He’s not going.  Steve Gomez is going in his place.
WALT,I’ve got money.  I’ve got more money than I know how to spend. What I don’t have is my family. I’ve got to put my life back together.  Somehow.
HANK,Asshole.
WALT,Yeah-yeah.  Why?
GUS,Is the food to your satisfaction?
JESSE,Those pheromones are supposed to kick ass.  I bet we catch this mofo any second.
WALT,How?
SKYLER,Can you turn that off?
SAUL,"Hell.  Welcome.  What a pleasure it is to have you!  I’m just gonna call you Skyler, if that’s okay. It’s a lovely name.  Reminds me of a... big beautiful sky.  Walt never told me lucky how lucky he was... prior to recent unfortunate events."
SKYLER,"Yes, you are."
HANK,Good.
JESSE,I know a dude wants to sell his.
JESSE,I don’t even know.
WALT,Eighty million.  And it’s yours. You can have it if you just let him drive away.
WALT,"Well, you wrote it wrong!  That’s not what I said.  I said eighty- five, it’s ALWAYS been eighty-five. Not seventy-five, not ninety-five. Eighty-five."
JESSE,Right on.  So do I need to sign something or something?
SKYLER,"Yeah, okay.  We’ll talk about it later."
MARIE,"So, where are you?  Are you at work?"
JESSE,I don’t know what you’re talking about.
MARIE,"Hey, if you can get your leg up that high, I say go for it!"
MARIE,"You know I love my little Pookums. You can leave her with me the next eighteen years, as far as I’m concerned."
WALT,A legal business!  Not this!
WALT,This?  This is an Erlenmeyer flask. You wouldn’t cook in one of these.
JESSE,It’s okay...  It’s okay.  Wanna see it again?
MARIE,What are you gonna tell them?
WALT,"I’ll tell you what I think it is. A ploy.  A ploy to get me cooking again.  And an obvious one, at that."
JESSE,It’s a disease on The Discovery Channel where all your intestines just sorta slip right outta your butt.
JESSE,"Um, crystal.  You think you could hook me up?"
HANK,Cheer up.  You people still got J. Lo.
MIKE,This is a professional courtesy. No one knows I’m here.  Understand?
JESSE,How long you think you’ve been awake?
MARIE,“Get well and best wishes from Ted Beneke and all the folks at Beneke Fabricators!”
JESSE,"Hey, Mr. White."
WALT,You wanna stay with me?
HANK,"Listen, I, uh..."
MARIE,I was... just wondering how you feel about that.
SKYLER,Jesus.
JESSE,"Just figure you could use some coffee, is all.  I know I could."
JESSE,"I can watch, yo.  I can cook, and I can watch."
GUS,"Good.  Now, I suggest that you add this to your Monday maintenance schedule..."
SAUL,Clearly his taste in women is the same as his taste in lawyers: only very best with just the right amount of dirty.
JESSE,"Please, just..?  Dumbass."
HANK,... he attacked me.
JESSE,"Hey, you can dress up like a faggot if you want.  Not me."
SAUL,"Plus, they got bumper boats.  So."
MARIE,You know what I mean.
JESSE,Nothing changes once I walk outta here.  I get myself a new RV and go start cooking again.
HANK,I’m gonna head back out after this.
HANK,"Upon hearing the news, I left Mr. Pinkman and his vehicle to attend to my wife.  After arriving at the hospital, I learned the emergency call was a hoax.  My wife, fortunately, was unharmed..."
WALT,"Let’s get our trays ready... clean, no moisture."
WALT,"-- Whatever.  Whatever, alright?! He’s a multi-millionaire!  What’s he gonna say, “Sorry, too bad, you’re on your own?”"
JESSE,One where the dudes who’re actually doin’ all the work ain’t gettin’ fisted!
WALT,"Red phosphorus, when heat is applied... oxidizes and yields carbonyl chloride.  Phosgene gas. One good whiff of it..."
SAUL,Send him in.
MARIE,"“Prying.”  Oh, that’s very --"
SKYLER,... That’s it.  That’s... it. There you go.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Keep it going.  Keep...
SKYLER,"Um, Marie, this is Ted.  My boss."
WALT JR,Damn.  TV does--add ten pounds.
JESSE,"Yeah, like yours was working."
SKYLER,I don’t want him to die at all! That’s the whole point of this! That’s why I asked you here --
SAUL,"Huh?  Was I right?  Where else you gonna find a cash-only business that’s this much fun?  Unless we’re talking massage parlor, and, uh... I don’t see it!"
SAUL,"Ladies, this is Jesse-San.  He’s in for the full treatment."
WALT JR,"Hey, so check it out.  See what this means?  Check out the date. Next Thursday is officially six months that I’ve had my learner’s. Which means..."
JESSE,Yeah.  I’m done using.
MIKE,"APD'9 been known to sit on this place, keep an eye on the comings and goinga."
WALT JR,I think I’d be good with either an old IROC or a ‘Stang.
SKYLER,Walt...
HANK,"Listen, I hate to bother you.  I just -- I just, uh, I just had a quick question."
GUS,"If push came to shove, I was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself. You, and, uh, an assistant."
HANK,How is your old man?  He back teaching?
WALT JR,Yeah.
SKYLER,Walt.  Where’s Holly?
JESSE,Whoa.  No...
SKYLER,Enough.
MARIE,Hank.  You get stronger every day. You don’t need to be in a hospital.
SAUL,"That’s simple.  Walt here came up with a great story about gambling winnings.  Blackjack, right?  Some card-counting system?"
MARIE,Jesus.  I gotta get back.
WALT,W-What if I showed you my secret? Every cook’s got his recipe -- what if I taught you mine?
MIKE,Walter.  You’ve been busy.
MARIE,"Does Walter, Jr. know about this?"
HANK,"It’s been an hour, right?  I’m hurting here.  I could use some meds."
WALT JR,"I’m asking you a question!  W-Why you gotta be like this?!  Why can’t you just TALK, even?!"
GUS,Sit down.
SKYLER,Wow.  Suddenly a fantasy story.
HANK,Marie... who?
HANK,Yeah.  Still there... but less.  A three.
MARIE,"... This is chrysanthemum  It looks like chrysanthemum.  Look at these, Hank, aren’t they beautiful?"
WALT,Walt.  Please call me Walt.
JESSE,"Yeah, no, no.  I’m gonna, I’m gonna make it count alright."
JESSE,Can I come in?
WALT,"No.  Listen...  My brother-in-law, he is surveilling Jesse’s house, you understand?"
WALT,"What’s the matter, Chief?  You having trouble walking there? Stand up.  Don’t be a retard. Stand up and walk."
JESSE,Who says we sell on the street? Maybe I know a whole new market.
SKYLER,No.  He’s just.  Quiet.
WALT,Okay.
WALT,"And you are the only edge that I’ve got, as long as they don’t know that you’re in town.  But I need you to track him.  Get me his address.  And I’ll do the rest."
WALT,"We are not married, Skyler, we’re divorced!"
JESSE,"So I started from scratch and made another.  Then another.  And by the end of the semester -- by, like, box number five?  I had built this thing..."
WALT,You did not have my permission --
SKYLER,What are you doing tomorrow?
HANK,"Hey, Baby."
HANK,"... convinced that Mr. Pinkman was involved in the manufacturing and distribution of phenyl-2 methamphetamine, specifically what we’re calling the “blue meth,” I tracked him to a scrap yard, where he stored an early ‘80s camper... an RV.  While waiting for a warrant to search this vehicle, which I believed to be a rolling meth lab... I received a phone call. Telling me my wife, Marie, had been injured in an accident."
WALT,I watched Jane die.
MARIE,Why can’t you just arrest him? Make him tell you?
HANK,Yes sir.
WALT,"Yeah, I’ll mow.  JPL’s got an exhibit of Mars rover photographs. Supposed to be, the detail... just really amazing.  Really beautiful."
JESSE,If you can’t see what it accomplishes... then there’s no way I can explain it to you.
WALT JR,"Sorry, Uncle Hank.  I won’t try to buy beer again, okay?"
SKYLER,I didn’t count it.  It’s-it’s heavy.  The bag.  Where he keeps it.
MARIE,"Holy Mary, mother of God."
WALT,"Oh. Yeah, you better.. ."
JESSE,Right.
JESSE,For free?
WALT JR,Whatcha been up to lately?  Haven’t seen you for a while.
SKYLER,Sizzle-Lean.  We need to think about our cholesterol.
WALT,It’s gonna be okay.
HANK,May I ask why?
WALT,We’re going.  We have to go. Everything is going to be fine.
SAUL,"Well, one look at this place, you’re gonna fall in love, so..."
MIKE,Your car.  Get it fixed.
SKYLER,"Okay, my estranged husband, who -- when he was working -- made forty- three thousand dollars a year, starts shoveling money at me.  And when the police come, I’m supposed to say “Gee, I, uh, never thought about it, officers.  Made sense to me!”  Really?  That, in your mind, is “plausible deniability.”"
WALT,Okay.
HANK,"Arabian what?  Jesus.  Camels, horses -- a towel-head is a towel-head.  You’re missing my..."
HANK,"Not cool, man.  Not cool."
WALT,Take a drive somewhere.  The almost four of us.
JESSE,"Yeah, but you’re the one sitting here, right?  Telling us thus and so, be happy, forgive yourself, blah-blah."
WALT JR,Why do we need to leave?
MARIE,"(not arguing, but not backing down either)"
WALT JR,Sure.
JESSE,What?
WALT,"I’m actually not here to, uh..."
WALT,#NAME?
JESSE,Um... I dunno.
JESSE,"I got this game.  The Laker Girls all have titties like pine cones. Yo, I’ll show you a trick move. You hit the x-button simultaneous with the --"
MARIE,Knock!  Knock!
SKYLER,Yep.
HANK,"Oh, yeah."
JESSE,"Nah, nah, nah... no shake ’n bake. Where’s your self-respect?  Come on."
JESSE,"I have never been more alone.  I have nothing!  No one.  Alright? And it’s all gone!  Get it?  No, no, no... why-why would you get it? What do you even care?!  As long as you get what you want, right?"
SKYLER,"Flynn, I’m taking you to school."
WALT,How’s the yield?
JESSE,"Yo, if this is s’posed to be all, like, Major League and all, we should have Equipment Maintainer Guys --"
HANK,"Who are you, huh?  Who are you and what do you know about this RV?"
SKYLER,Would you please just --
WALT JR,What’s this--even--made of?!
SKYLER,Oh -- what do you think of Holly?
WALT,Yeah.
HANK,"I don’t get the gag, jag-off.  Who is this?"
HANK,"Marie, I’m working, alright?"
WALT,"It’s a frontrunner, for sure."
WALT,"Oh, hey."
WALT,It’s fine.  Really.  I have a guy.
WALT,"It’s not negligible.  Ball-parking it, I’d say we’re a quarter to a half pound shy."
HANK,I hope it goes without saying...
WALT,"Ah.  Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, 2000 milliliters.  Very nice.  You got your Griffin beakers, you got your volumetric.  But check this out -- the pièce de résistance. Round bottom boiling flask, 5000 milliliters."
MIKE,"But our employer would find out. Like always.  And, if Pinkman were arrested... he’d take it as a problem."
SKYLER,"I really just need this quick and easy.  As quick as, you know, something like this can be."
WALT JR,"You are shittin’ me, right?"
MARIE,"Flynn, your mother’s telling the truth, right here and now.  Believe it."
WALT,It’s complicated.
SKYLER,Oh my God.  Is that you?
JESSE,I bought it from the two guys who killed Combo.
WALT,No.  Why would it?
SKYLER,But you can’t sell that for very long --
SAUL,"“Free?”  Oh ladies, cover your ears!"
JESSE,"Know what is okay to put in hot dogs, huh?  Pig lips and assholes. I say have at it, bitches -- ‘cause I love hot dogs!  And uh, you know, see what I’m -- ?"
SKYLER,Do you have a minute?
MIKE,"Oh, you’re never too old for balloons."
JESSE,"Like, uh... one fly?  Singular?"
JESSE,What’s the point of being an outlaw when you got responsibilities?
MIKE,You’re gonna wanna get your car fixed.
JESSE,"Firecrackers?  Um, you know, I have any firecrackers on me.  Who does a trick with firecrackers?"
GUS,"Then they weren’t bad decisions. What does a man do, Walter?"
WALT,I’m not complaining.
WALT,Oncologist...
GUS,Wwould you slice the garlic?  Very thin.
WALT,"I have made a series of very bad decisions, and I cannot make another one."
SAUL,"Okay, so, what’s Plan B?"
JESSE,You’re late.
MIKE,"Now... when I say I’m looking for Pinkman, we both know why.  Don’t we?  And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me."
WALT,You wanna... you wanna start?
WALT,"Growth, decay.  Transformation. It’s fascinating, really."
SKYLER,Have you thought anymore about what we discussed?
WALT,"Oh, I’ll get it."
MARIE,You’re sure it’s okay to drink.
WALT,Non-toxic glue strips.
JESSE,"That is bullshit.  That is bullshit, Krazy-8!  I should kick his punk ass for even thinking that.  Next time you talk to Emilio, you tell him for me."
SKYLER,"Ohhh-kay... um, does your “guy” know the tax code and regulations for New Mexico?  Cause, there’s very specific paperwork that has to be submitted quarterly on this."
SKYLER,Don’t worry about the baby.  This is for you.  We’re only doing you tonight.
JESSE,No.  It’s not.
WALT,I’m late.  I have to go.
MIKE,"Bye, baby."
SKYLER,Contact Pinkman.  Get him to drop these charges.
WALT JR,"Oh, yeah?  That’s great!"
SAUL,"You buy this place, all you got is a big building that squirts water. You got no Danny here."
JESSE,Knock yourself out.
WALT,He’s not coming down.
MARIE,Cheese sticks.
JESSE,What happens now?  I’ll tell you what happens now.  Your scumbag brother-in-law is finished.  Done. You understand?  I will own him when this is over.
WALT,I’ve listened to everything you had to say.  And I appreciate how much thought you’ve put into my situation.  But don’t you think I’ve gone through all this in my head a thousand times and weighed all my options?
JESSE,"You know he’s not the first.  They use kids ‘cause hey, why not?  Easy to control.  Easy to fool.  All they get is juvie if they ever get caught.  Hearts and minds, right? Get ‘em young and they’re yours forever."
MIKE,Whoa.  You are good right there.
JESSE,What in the hell just happened?
SKYLER,Walt.
MARIE,It’s good to have you here.  Both of you.
WALT,"Ah.  Well, uh..."
JESSE,You didn’t hit it?
JESSE,... what?
WALT,Just.  Moved.
SAUL,You ever actually play laser tag? You know... it’s good cardio.  Plus you get to shoot at kids...
SAUL,-- So get rid of it!  What’re you doing sitting there talking to me for?!
SKYLER,"No, just... a family meeting.  A safe place where everyone can voice their concerns and be heard."
WALT,And then what?
MIKE,Yeah?  Funny how words can be so open to interpretation.
MARIE,Hank...
WALT,"I-I sit down and this man, this stranger, he engages me in conversation.  He’s a complete stranger."
JESSE,"I say -- I say we just ram him, alright?  We, uh we, we start her up, just ram the shit out of his truck... and make our escape! Right?!"
MIKE,She’s gonna need her shoe.
WALT,I wouldn’t even know where to begin.  You have no idea... I spend my day drawing atoms on a chalkboard.  Making kids memorize the periodic table.
WALT,Half a million in cash.
HANK,"Try that one again, wouldja?"
WALT,Shows what I know about art.
JESSE,Jesus!  They know what you’re doing with this!  Any goddamn retard they got workin’ a register’s gonna know you’re making crystal!  You’re probably on some list now!
JESSE,"And so, it’s not so much that it got trapped but he was living there, you know?  Under the house. You could hear him going from, like, room to room.  Always, uh, scurrying around down there. Sometimes I’d see him outside at night and it’d just, you know,"
SKYLER,No.  No police.  Where are you? Where’s Holly?  Walt..?
HANK,Yeah?  I got twenty bucks says he’s a beaner.
GUS,Three million dollars for three months of your time.
HANK,What was your son’s name?
SKYLER,Is this a good time to talk?
JESSE,"Y’know, I-I-I don’t get it.  Why would anyone paint a picture of a door?  Over and over again, like dozens of times?"
WALT,"Chad, keep your hands to yourself please.  Is there something wrong with your own table?"
GUS,North of the border is my territory.  My say.
HANK,"You got your pride.  I get it.  You wanna take care of everything yourself.  But you don’t have to, pal.  We’re all here for you.  And if this Daddy Warbucks wants to chip in... well, I gotta agree with your old lady on this one.  Take the money and run."
SKYLER,Just close your eyes.
SKYLER,tIh'me wgeoeinkgentdo. Hank and Marie's for
WALT JR,This guy’s good.
JESSE,Alright.
SKYLER,Okay.  I will think about that.
WALT,Alright.
SKYLER,Yeah.  Yeah.  Where else could you possibly make that kind of money?
JESSE,What was that?
GUS,You don’t look at him.  You look at me.
MARIE,Guess what?
MIKE,"Um... I used to be a beat cop, long time ago.  And I’d get called out on domestic disputes all the time. Hundreds, probably, over the years. But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit that I will never forget.  Gordie.  He looked like Bo Svenson.  You remember him? “Walking Tall?”  You don’t remember?"
JESSE,"Okay, fine.  I guess the cow skull pictures were cool, but... a DOOR? I will say it again.  A door. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..."
WALT,I’ll admit he comes across like a circus clown... but he actually knows what he’d doing.
SKYLER,"I pretty much supported us while he did some post-doctoral work.  But really, here’s the thing:  I am not looking for any kind of loopholes, or, I dunno --"
WALT JR,Why do I always have to do it?
SKYLER,This feels fantastic.  Can you control the temperature?
SKYLER,I mean it.  You understand?
JESSE,So what?
WALT,This is not an easy decision.  But it is one that I have to make.  I’m sorry.  This whole Gale situation. He’s-he’s just not working out.
MARIE,He-he swung at you with something...
WALT JR,"Man, he got you good!"
JESSE,What do you mean?  A fly like... like what do you mean?
WALT,Why?
SKYLER,"Walt, he wouldn’t offer you a job if he didn’t think you were qualified --"
JESSE,It’s four grand.  My guy wants forty-five hundred.
MIKE,"Well, I’m not gonna do it."
WALT,"That’s got to be unusual, right? That kind of cash?"
MARIE,But you can’t know for sure.
MIKE,I trust the hole in the desert I’d leave you in.
SKYLER,Good to see you -- we missed you the last time.  I think you were in Rwanda or something...
SKYLER,Where’s Hank?
GUS,I need to talk to you about something.  Something rather pressing.
MARIE,Your father’s in custody.  You’re not going to be able to talk to him for a while.
WALT,That wouldn’t account for this much.  The materials aren’t out that long.
WALT,I’ve had it before.  Low blood sugar.  Stood up too fast.
WALT,It’s my brother-in-law -- he knows about the RV!
WALT,"Jesus, Skyler.  You really want to know?  I mean, d’you you really want to know?!  Really?"
SKYLER,My g(uoesffs whaiss sGnroetchen Schwartz. Something was goinrtg) on between you. I just knew.
JESSE,"I don’t know what you think you’re doing here, Mr. White.  If you’re planning on giving me some bullshit about getting right with Jesus or something, turning myself in --"
MIKE,Driving.  Is she good behind the wheel?
SKYLER,Marie!  Jesus.
WALT JR,"So if it’s okay, I was thinking I’d use this one for the test."
WALT,"Leave it.  One batch, one ship. Stop complicating things."
WALT,He’ll live.
WALT,We wait.
GUS,"This is a Chilean dish that I love, but... I never get to make it. Kids won’t eat it.  But, uh...  You know how that is."
SAUL,"Hello, Walt.  Good to see you. Please, uh... have a seat.  Here."
JESSE,"Nothing.  Just... I had this partner who was helping me cook.  I mean, I did most of the work.  The dude didn’t know what he was doing, and things got dicked up.  I had to let him go."
MARIE,#NAME?
WALT,"Uh, no.  Why would you... what?"
WALT,I’d like to buy it.
JESSE,"It’s like I’m on an airplane, yo. What the hell’s doing that?!"
WALT JR,"Ha, ha dad.  You’re not going to get off that easy."
WALT,"Exactly.  But actually, I prefer ether."
JESSE,"So, you want me to buy this place so I can pay taxes?  I’m a criminal, yo."
WALT,Jesse...
JESSE,Uh-huh.
WALT,Oh God.  Oh God.
SKYLER,I’m sorry.  I didn’t think you’d be so upset about it.  What did he say to you?
WALT,Need a ride?
WALT,"You’re still in our filing system. Your aunt owns this place, right?"
WALT JR,What’s--that?
JESSE,We sell it safe.  Alright?  We sell it smart.
MARIE,You’ve been doing this since we were kids!  You’d throw a fit if you didn’t get your way!
WALT,Yeah.
HANK,Never mind about your “coffee break.”  Take me up.  I’m done.
MARIE,You want a coffee?
SAUL,"Believe me, money-laundering ain’t what it used to be."
JESSE,"Yeah, yeah... hey.  Hey, I been crunching numbers, alright?!"
WALT,"Look, I hope you’re not waiting for an apology because I did not “rat you out”?  I was looking out for your best interests as well as my own.  And I stand behind my decision 100%, so we’ll just have to agree to disagree.  Anyway, just... call me back."
SKYLER,"Thanks for stopping by.  But, it’s... actually, not the best time for a visit.  So..."
HANK,Thanks for this -- I really appreciate it.
MARIE,She’s already finished an entire bottle but she still seemed hungry. Then she fell asleep.  I was thinking I’d give her another when she wakes up.
JESSE,Hey.
HANK,This kid?  I swear to God -- I wish I could just...
MARIE,"You mean, gang up on him.  Like an intervention."
WALT,Buy the RV.  We start tomorrow.
GUS,No.  This time I choose.
HANK,"Just don’t go native on me, alright?"
WALT,It’s a loan-out.  It’s fine.
JESSE,There’s got to be some other way.
JESSE,Two-oh-two and change.  You okay getting home?
SKYLER,Whatever Hank was investigating... Him trying to find an RV.  Is there any danger that could lead back to you?
WALT,I will mow.  First thing.
JESSE,My ears are popping.
JESSE,"So, uh, we’re good?"
WALT,"Think of the odds?  Once I tried to calculate them, but they’re astronomical."
JESSE,Who’d he say he killed?
HANK,"Take me up, take me up!"
SKYLER,"Ted, it’s just... this whole thing with Hank has been one non-stop horror show, you know?  So..."
HANK,Yes sir.
WALT,"Just let me, please.  Please?! Please let me talk to him!!"
WALT JR,Okay.  A 1971 Mach 1 fastback in Grabber Lime... with a shaker hood... ‘Stang.
WALT JR,What?
SKYLER,Walt?
JESSE,"Yeah?  Well, I mean...  Some things."
WALT,Buy the RV.  We start tomorrow.
MIKE,Good.
WALT,Apples and oranges.
WALT,"What’s to find out?  It’s a dispute over turf, right?  I mean, how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf and kill them months ago?"
MARIE,"I’ll be right back, okay?"
JESSE,"For a teenth?  Shit, c’mon, yo."
WALT,Huh.  Cap’n Cook?  That’s not you?
HANK,"No, it wasn’t one mistake.  I’ve been..."
JESSE,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up!"
WALT,No.
SAUL,"Yo, Adrian.  Rocky called -- he wants his face back."
JESSE,"What about the, uh, the other one?"
JESSE,What are you two even doing here? --
WALT,Where-where..?  How did you know how to put this all together?
SKYLER,"Walter, Jr.?  I know there’s something going on up there -- now’s your chance to spit it out."
JESSE,Jesus.
SKYLER,When’ll you be home?
MARIE,"You know that you can talk to me about things, right?  You don’t have to go through this alone."
WALT JR,"Yeah, put him in jail!  What’s God gotta do with it? --"
SKYLER,"Okay.  I guess we can start going around the circle.  You’re all an important part of this family, and"
WALT,Skyler...
JESSE,"Oh!  Zzzzzap!  Somebody got GOT, yo!  You see that Mister..?"
MARIE,I spoke with Blanca.  She said that Steven’s going to El Paso?
JESSE,Thank you.  Yo!  Thank you.
JESSE,What?
WALT,Cook whatever you like -- as long as it’s that ridiculous “Chili P” or some other drek.  But don’t even think about using my formula.
HANK,"C’mon, you little rat-bastard... get off your lazy ass and go break the law."
SKYLER,"I just sold your favorite piece -- the hideous crying clown.  Got nine bucks more than I paid for it, too."
JESSE,Hey.  ‘Sup.  My name’s Jesse.
WALT,Positive pressure.
JESSE,"This is a beaker.  A Griffin beaker, to be exact.  This is a volumetric beaker.  Erlenmeyer flask, Kjeldahl-style recovery flask..."
JESSE,Surprised he doesn’t make us do that.
JESSE,"I mean, mhat’s the point of shutting yourself off completely from something that... lifts you off the ground?  I spend so much energy fighting the urge not to use, and I feel like crap ‘cause of it..."
WALT,"bUahc. k Jfourst aBwohyiioeu. kInow, I Won't be surgery on Friday. 'm having ny"
JESSE,"Off of Central.  Like, over by the train tracks..?"
WALT,No.  Hank --
MARIE,These things they laughingly call pillows... I would not give them to prison inmates.
MARIE,"I’m betting it will.  And if he does, you check out of here."
HANK,Nope.
WALT,"Alright, well...  No, no... come on.  Come on."
JESSE,No!  NO!
SAUL,Drum roll please... wait for it...
HANK,My name is ASAC Schrader.  And you can go fuck yourself.
SAUL,"Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice clean, taxable income brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business."
SKYLER,"When Walt was diagnosed -- it, um, it changed him.  Looking back, I don’t think I ever really understood what it was that he was going through.  It was more than facing death.  It was knowing that he was going to leave behind... nothing.  And so that’s how this all started.  For better or worse, he wanted to provide."
JESSE,I don’t know.  What’s it matter? Who cares? I got it.
JESSE,"Why don’t you just, uh, leave him be?  Let the traps do the work."
WALT,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What are you doing?"
JESSE,Ah.  Damn.
WALT JR,"I’m pissed off at you.  ‘Cause you’re a coward.  You get cancer, and two minutes later you’re ready to give up.  What if you’d given up on me?  Remember when I could barely stand -- how you helped me every day ‘til I was able to walk? Remember how hellacious that was? And you’re scared of a little chemotherapy?"
JESSE,What else did he tell you?
SKYLER,You killed him.  You killed Hank.
WALT,On-nne...
WALT,"I’ll, uh... I’ll follow you."
SKYLER,I’ll take you to school.
HANK,Moment of truth.
SAUL,What RV?
WALT,I’m sorry about Jane.
WALT,"Oh, shit."
JESSE,What.  Are you doing?
JESSE,Seriously.  Get a beer with me.
WALT,Happy Birthday.
WALT,"Something that keeps him off the street for say, 30 days?  Then, by the time he gets out, tempers have cooled and hopefully we can move on."
WALT JR,"Hey, Aunt Marie."
JESSE,What did you talk about?
GUS,Probing for weakness.
WALT JR,‘Scuse me?
GUS,Sunset.
SKYLER,Yeah...
MARIE,"Listen, you knock your way, Groucho, I’ll knock mine."
WALT,Pinkman.  You still owe me.
GUS,We’re working together... why not break bread together?
JESSE,Yeah.  I do.
WALT,This is a raisin.
MIKE,I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman and this plan of yours.
WALT,"No, it’s pretty straightforward. I’ll show you when we get there."
SAUL,"Yeah, that was for your partner. Privileges of seniority and all -- but for you it’s the usual seventeen percent, and... that’s a bargain."
SKYLER,"Thanks a lot, Marie!  Nice ambush!"
WALT,Very much.
SKYLER,You’re right.  You’re right.
JESSE,That you went to a bar?
JESSE,"Hey.  It will be.  Step One, we build inventory.  Badger, go see Clovis.  Get the RV in shape.  Tune up, oil change, brake lights and whatnot.  Cops always pull you over brake lights.  Not us.  Cautious."
JESSE,Yeah?
WALT,"Well, what did you think he was gonna do?  You tell the man I’m dying --"
MARIE,"Hey, did you know that the doctors told your Uncle Hank that he can get out of here any time he wants to?"
HANK,This thing doesn’t do a damned thing.
HANK,"So, I immediately went back to the salvage yard, but the RV was gone. Most likely destroyed on site."
JESSE,"Alright, imagine these two guys had Patrick working as a mule.  Making him kill people.  Wouldn’t you do anything to protect your kid?"
WALT,Skyler.  Hey.
WALT,Sure.
WALT,"Hank, please.  You’ve gotta tell him we can work this out.  Hank..."
SKYLER,Sizzle-lean.  We’re watching our cholesterol.
WALT,Wh-what is that?  That’s hearsay. Do you have any proof?
HANK,"You get that out of my house.  You hear me, Marie?  Today."
WALT,"Skyler, there’s-there’s a lotta angles to this, alright?  It is complicated.  Let’s just sit back down and talk it through."
SKYLER,Laser Tag.
JESSE,What the hell’s that s’posed to mean?
WALT,I’ll do the treatment.
SAUL,Howsabout we run through this thing one more time.  Especially the part where I do all the talking and you don’t say jack.
JESSE,Wait... WHAT?
SKYLER,"Somehow, something tells me that"
GUS,Come on.  You can help me cook.
JESSE,It’s not your fault.
GUS,"I believe in you, Gale.  I know that when the time comes, you will be ready."
JESSE,Get offa me!  Get off!
GUS,But it doesn’t.
JESSE,"Guy eats ricin -- two, three days later he gets the flu or a heart attack or something and keels over. That’s what you said.  Untraceable back to us!"
JESSE,"You cook more tomorrow.  Meantime, I know just the guy to talk to."
WALT,"Well, I didn’t vote for that."
HANK,"One minute before they attacked me, somebody called my cell and told me to expect it."
JESSE,"So, like... what makes you the expert?"
JESSE,"We did, this one time.  Back when it was my aunt’s house, back before she died of cancer.  Was a possum. Big, freaky looking bitch."
HANK,"That’s exactly what I’m sayin’. Now deal, you little prick."
SKYLER,"Yeah,  thought so, too.  The truth is, he never took their money -- not a dime.  He was too proud to take what he considered to be charity."
GUS,Your new lab.
HANK,Nope.  Working on it.  So...
SKYLER,Hi.  Is everything okay?
JESSE,What do you want?
GUS,Where’d they cross?
SKYLER,"I’m just saying, you know?  We have a history.  He’s the father of my children.  And maybe what he did, he did --"
JESSE,Are you okay?
HANK,Yeah?  Who?
WALT,I gotta go.
WALT,This is between me and him.
JESSE,I already did my time.  Why don’t you just go get yourself a monkey?
SAUL,"Yeah.  There’s guns and glo-lites, and kids wear the vests and runa round in teams--"
MARIE,What the hell is this?
WALT JR,I only got nabbed ‘cause the other guys ran.
GUS,Listen to me.  You have one friend in this room.
WALT,"Absolutely.  An entire chain of events had to occur.  Fail-safes -- fail-safes and redundancies are built into such a system.  No one person, no one cause can be... attributed!  For instance, there was some sort of collision radar on the jet that may not have been working properly.  That is public record!  Look it up!"
GUS,"Well, when I first started out, I made a lot of mistakes.  More than I care to admit.  I wish I’d had someone to advise me.  Because this life of ours... it can overwhelm."
WALT,"That’s not why I’m here, Jesse. There’s more."
WALT JR,Here you go...  Got it.
JESSE,"I ain’t buying, ese.  I’m selling."
WALT,"Your money.  Saul is keeping it for you, so as soon as you’re feeling better..."
JESSE,"Money, mainly."
WALT JR,You know what?  This is bullshit!
HANK,Closer...
WALT,These are my good clothes.  I can’t go home smelling like a meth lab.
HANK,No shit.  Old man Walt’s tokin’ up? Did he even inhale?
HANK,"Marie, let the people who get paid to do this do this."
JESSE,You’re doing it.
JESSE,"Stove fuel... not enough of it. Lye.  You got the generic crap. Red Devil’s better.  Iodine, matches... also not my brand."
WALT,I’m just... we gotta be careful of the baby.
HANK,"Just a little.  And I SO do not care about that.  As far as I’m concerned, you never inhaled, okay? Like you said, cut to the chase. Do you remember if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?"
JESSE,"No, I need it today.  Now."
SAUL,Hey-hey.  Escalating.  Stop.
WALT,"Bye, Son.  Hey, good work today."
WALT,But thank you anyway.  It was very kind of you and Elliott.
HANK,That’s the way it happened.
MIKE,"Well, of course.  Just trying to do the right thing."
WALT,For the good of my family.
JESSE,"What the hell, man?"
JESSE,"Nah, they’re onto that.  They got dogs that sniff around."
SAUL,That’s it?  That’s what you wanna buy?
WALT,Shoot.
SKYLER,Turning forty was a big deal.  I know I’m not looking forward to it.
SKYLER,I guess crime does pay.
SKYLER,#NAME?
SKYLER,a--Nbdio oI st ut apl t g peea ao as ltl tmt e thinking yet again rano h cf e ew s . h tircahnwgeasbeyohuarvior.
HANK,Yeah.
WALT,Elliott... this is... this is very appealing.  But you should know... I’ve got some... personal issues.
SKYLER,"Well, it’s a little late on that. This is what happens when you decide to pay our bills with drug money."
SKYLER,"Apparently, you know, even... parts of bodies..?  I mean, I couldn’t bring myself to go over there."
WALT,I sure hope we have enough.
SKYLER,"Hey, uh, did you know your Dad and I are thinking about maybe starting a business together?"
WALT JR,Fine.
HANK,"Well, it’s a long story, but I’m personally of the opinion that he’s moved on from weed and has graduated to selling crystal meth. Using it as a rolling lab."
WALT,"What, like a Winnebago?"
JESSE,Where we going?
JESSE,"‘Cause I never said I wouldn’t cook it!  ‘Cause it ain’t yours, it’s OURS!  Plural, bitch!"
SKYLER,"God, I could go for a glass of wine about now.  Do you wanna go -- sorry, never mind.  Ech.  Anyway."
WALT,You know why I do this.  I want security for my family.
SAUL,"Can you take a Xanax?  Cause, I got a drawer full of ‘em.  I, uh, I get ‘em from my --"
JESSE,‘Cause I just found out about ‘em.
JESSE,Yeah.  Me too.
SKYLER,"Oh, yeah?"
SKYLER,You worked here four years.  It’s a business you understand.  It’s a story people will believe.  Not Laser Tag.  This.  This is what we buy.
SKYLER,Eat it.
JESSE,Good.
SKYLER,Great.  Thanks Marie.
SKYLER,You’re not gonna mow?
WALT,You want something to drink?
JESSE,Right.  So you can get your five percent.
WALT,"dLoiseteenn,'t Jheeslps,e. beLlieinvgeermineg. onJutshti.n..gs Atrlyrigahntd? focus on getting better."
SKYLER,"Safe and cautious, that’s all I’m asking -- and that man is neither."
SKYLER,Yeah.
WALT,"No..?  My God, Walt.  Cocaine..?"
WALT,"You look nice, honey."
JESSE,"Tomás does tricks with firecrackers, huh.  Who’s Tomás?"
SKYLER,I could hardly believe it either. But he admitted it to me point- blank.  He was buying pot from a former student of his... this skeevy little shit.
JESSE,"You-you are not like how I remember you from class.  I mean, like, not at all."
JESSE,"Oh, gee, thanks.  Well...  Not interested.  I’ve got my own thing goin’ on.  Nice try saving your asshat brother-in-law."
WALT,"Well, can you recite it?"
WALT,You know.  Same.
GUS,Is there a ringing in your ears?
WALT JR,"MI'mom. pretty sure he didn't bring it,"
JESSE,#NAME?
SKYLER,Married couples can’t be compelled to testify against one another.  So there’s that.
JESSE,And you seriously wanna get high?!
JESSE,Yeah.  I’ll keep the peace.
MIKE,"I’m gonna need your full attention, Saul.  Jesse Pinkman.  Current whereabouts.  The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to..."
HANK,"Yeah, exactly.  One whiff’ll kill you.  That’s why the moon suits."
MARIE,Here’s what you’re gonna tell them.
WALT,Where’s your belly button?  Where is it?  There it is!  I see it.
SKYLER,"And as with most things, the Devil is in the details.  So to begin with, what are we saying is the source of this money?"
WALT,Yes.  I know.
JESSE,These two...
WALT,Nice to meet you.
JESSE,Just hold onto it.  Hold it still.
GUS,Has Walter ever talked to you about why he got into this particular line of work..?
JESSE,"Ninety-six million dollars! Alright, ninety-six!  Million! Ninety-six to our three!"
SKYLER,"Because youre a liar, Walt."
JESSE,"... So, exactly what kind of contaminant are we dealing with here?"
JESSE,Tomorrow.  I’ll be in touch.
MARIE,"Well, I didn’t see that."
WALT,"Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process.  I try to be as vague as possible, but I’ve got that guy Victor watching me, listening to every word I say..."
MARIE,I don’t know how to talk to him.  I don’t know what to say to him anymore.  I don’t know how to...
JESSE,Hey.  Sit down.
JESSE,"I am moving it around, alright! It’s not working!"
WALT JR,You’re completely out of your mind.
WALT,Yeah.  Better.
WALT JR,"Yeah, I need the police.  My dad pulled a knife on my mom.  He attacked her.  He’s dangerous and I think he might’ve killed somebody."
WALT,Will you please get your things together?  You and the kids.  This is our priority.
HANK,"Yeah, we’re not sure about that."
JESSE,"Good.  So, um.  You ready to talk some business?"
JESSE,"I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, Here, man Right here, right --"
WALT JR,"Then you’re both out of your minds! You’re full of shit, is what you are!  Both of you!"
HANK,What do those look like to you?
WALT,"Thank you, I know what Ebola is. Now tell me -- what would a West African virus be doing in our lab, hmm?"
SKYLER,You’re late.
JESSE,Wait.  Hold up.  Tell me why you’re doing this.  Seriously.
WALT,"That you believe I have some proprietary kind of... selfishness about my own formula.  Hmm?  Some sort of... overweening pride, I suppose, that you think simply overwhelms me.  Clouds my judgement."
HANK,"Well, it’s not that simple, Baby. There’s a little thing called The Const --"
WALT JR,"This is so stupid.  He’s not gonna change his mind, so we might as well save our breath."
HANK,Hey...
GUS,I’m told his product was more or less consistent with the quality I had come to expect.
JESSE,"Yeah, Baby!  It’s got PHEROMONES."
JESSE,You’re damn right it belongs to me.
JESSE,"Look, you had your bump.  We get this thing done and then you can have all you want."
WALT,Hi.
SAUL,"You wanna stay out of jail, dontcha?  You wanna keep your money and your freedom?  Because I’ve got three little letters for you:  I--R- -S.  If they can get Capone, they can get you."
GUS,"No, clearly you’re not.  No rational person would do as you have done."
HANK,"No, not that.  Why you calling me and not your dad?"
MARIE,Of course.  And I-I want him safe. But I can’t tell what he wants.  He won’t talk to me...
SKYLER,"Ah.  A “’Stang,” mm-hmm?"
JESSE,I will show you exactly how easy it is...
WALT,"Short speech.  You lost your partner today.  What’s-his-name, Emilio?  Emilio’s going to prison."
WALT,Chemistry is the study of what?
GUS,Say it.
SAUL,"Hey, what’re the parameters of this sobriety thing you got going?"
GUS,Do you mind...?
GUS,Where is Pinkman now?
WALT,Jesse..?
SKYLER,Please stop talking about dying --
SAUL,"Don’t you get it?  On the outside it’s a nail salon, right -- on the inside it’s the best money laundry a growing boy could ask for."
SKYLER,"No.  Oh my God... Walt, NO!"
SKYLER,"So he, every spare minute, Walt was at some card table somewhere.  At first he went to casinos, but then he realized that..."
HANK,"That’s the one.  I’m positive that little bastard’s got an RV, I just don’t know where he keeps it.  And until he actually leads me to it -- or does something! -- I’m stuck here, Marie.  I’m sorry."
WALT,I just wish there was something more that we could do.
JESSE,No one misses it more than me.
WALT,Not in here.
MIKE,Chow.  You have anything you wanna tell me?
HANK,"Oh, hey, uh, here."
JESSE,I heard it from the sister of the kid who shot him.
WALT,Really.
HANK,Brandon Mayhew.  I know you.
HANK,Mmm. Not the most we ever took.
JESSE,I dunno...
WALT,"I was, I was at home watching TV. Some, some nature program about elephants.  Skyler and Holly were in another room.  I could hear them on the baby monitor.  She was singing a lullaby."
GUS,Ah... morning.
WALT,"W-Why are you doing this?!  Why are you, why are you thinking this way? Is this to punish me?! --"
WALT,This COST me my family.
SKYLER,"Dinner’s almost ready, okay?"
WALT,"Skyler, I had nothing to do --"
JESSE,Hey.  It’s me.  Wait for the thing.
SKYLER,"Do you even know Walt?  I mean, how would he, of all people, buy a Laser Tag business?  It-it doesn’t add up."
WALT,"C'mon, let's get you outta here."
SKYLER,Just relax.  Just... close your eyes and let it...
JESSE,No.
WALT,Where’s the remote?
SAUL,"‘Kay.  Here’s your cash.  You’re out on the town, yeah, you’re “partying hearty,” you’re knockin’ boots with the chicky babes.  And -- uhh -- Who’s this?"
WALT,"No.  We sell it, we don’t smoke it."
HANK,"... THE single SHITTIEST week since 9/11 -- hands-down.  This is it!  We’re living it!  I mean, and I say this with some authority, ‘cause we definitely had some shitty weeks the last six months. But this right here?  Call Guinness, man.  Call... freakin’..."
WALT,"You wanna talk about trust, Jesse? Let’s talk about trust?  I told you NOT to cook my formula and you went ahead and did it anyway!"
MARIE,This is that Pinkman character?
WALT,"Yeah, well I know I would be in prison after this.  Prison or worse.  And I’d be right alongside you."
GUS,Understand?
SKYLER,"Walt, I don’t know what is going on with you lately --"
SKYLER,"We’re in the process of moving him out.  Yeah.  Today, hopefully.  In the meantime, my son and daughter and I are staying with my sister."
SKYLER,We’re married.  How am I not in this?
SKYLER,"Okay, thanks."
MIKE,"Now, just what the hell was that, exactly?"
MIKE,"Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter. Downstairs."
JESSE,Who’s here? --
GUS,"You would choose your own hours, of course, come and go as you please. So long as the quota is met."
HANK,A hospital bed.
MARIE,Please.  It’s tens of thousands of dollars --
WALT JR,"Dad, Mom and Aunt Marie, they told me you were arrested!  They’re saying you’re some kind of drug dealer!"
HANK,"Hey, check it out, Walt -- these assholes like their shoeboxes better’n Bank Of America."
MIKE,"Walter.  The sooner you figure out what this is, the sooner we all go home."
SKYLER,"So... this is it, honey."
HANK,Go back to your trailers... everything’s okay.
SKYLER,It’s like I’m paralyzed.  Like if I take a step in any direction I’m gonna make a spectacular mistake.
HANK,"Marie...  Give up... I mean, seriously.  It’s... not... gonna happen."
JESSE,"You can’t get your nut up to sell, what’s the point of even coming?"
JESSE,"That’s ours, right?"
WALT,T Sky? Whhiant kdIomyoauy juthsintk?keep this.
SKYLER,Yes.  He’s a high school teacher. Chemistry teacher.
JESSE,"You, uh, you Tomás?"
SAUL,Bzzt!  Wrong!  Million times worse - - you’re a tax cheat!  What do they do?
SKYLER,He’s fine.  What do you mean?
JESSE,"No... listen to me, you get that address..."
SAUL,Wha-what did we say about escalating?  Huh?  Who’s got your back here?  Me.  Alright.  I’m gonna take care of things.
SKYLER,What?
HANK,I didn’t see it coming.
HANK,"Nah, I didn’t see shit.  Day late and a dollar short, as usual.  Only reason I’m even breathing is I got a warning call."
WALT,Name one thing in this world that is not negotiable.
JESSE,See?  I told you I got it.
HANK,With the Drug Enforcement Administration.   We’re interested in an RV that’s registered to your name and address.
WALT,Options.
SKYLER,"“Hey everybody, Walt suddenly decided to invest in laser tag! Just out of the blue!”  Really? That’s what we’re supposed to tell people -- our family, our friends... the government..."
SAUL,"That’s the way of the world, kid. You go with the winner."
SKYLER,"Love you, too."
WALT,What about you?
GUS,I need two hundred pounds per week to make this economically viable.
JESSE,Bet that’s it.
JESSE,"Oh, and you know that buzzer thing?"
JESSE,Burgers are getting cold.
WALT,"Well, I do.  And I would prefer to die holding my head up high, rather than eating shit."
SAUL,“We’re GOOD?”  This constitutes “good” where you’re from?  My car is bugged --
MIKE,"No more half measures, Walter."
SAUL,"Wha --  You-you’re gonna need that money laundered, right?  I mean, of course."
JESSE,"And you can never talk to anyone, right?  I mean ever, understand?"
JESSE,"I guess he was like a Marine or somethin’, before he got old.  He was hard of hearing.  My, uh... my project for his class was to make this, um, wooden box.  Like a small... um... just, like..."
SKYLER,"Hey, I don’t love this situation, alright?  That you put me in! However, let’s just stick with what makes sense here:  You took the seed money you won gambling, you invested it in the car wash that you helped run for four years.  You hired your wife as a bookkeeper, because guess what?  She’s actually a bookkeeper.  Now, that is a story an auditor can believe.  So what am I missing?"
HANK,I’m not letting this sucker outta my sight.  There’s gotta be a way. There’s gotta be a way...  There’s gotta be a way...
JESSE,Positive what?
WALT,He’s here.
WALT,My partner was about to get himself shot.  I intervened.
GUS,"Now, I intend to keep Walter on for as long as he wants, assuming he’s physically up to it.  But as he cannot or will not tell me how long that might be..."
JESSE,"Okay, so, good.  Great."
WALT,You know what?  Call me crazy.  But I-I’m actually feeling very good about the future.
JESSE,"Free to cook anytime, anywhere. No quotas.  No one to answer to."
SAUL,"Besides, this dump isn’t gonna work because it doesn’t have a Danny. Okay?  There’s no Danny here!"
JESSE,"I’m out risking my ass to get product for you two, and you’re too pussy to sell?!  You’re pathetic."
WALT,"People will believe it, at least. I worked here four years."
WALT,"This is...  I...  Jesse, I-I am... so sorry for this.  This should not have happened."
SKYLER,Mmm.
JESSE,How ‘bout we stop somewhere afterward and get a beer?
GUS,What would you like to happen?
WALT,"Wouldn’t miss it for the world. Happy birthday, Elliott."
WALT,Sometimes... compromises have to be made...  For the best of reasons.
WALT JR,"So, nine AM Saturday."
MIKE,"Okay, Junebug, these are for you?"
WALT,What the hell are you doing? --
WALT,Wait.
HANK,"Amir, this guy’s name is?  Jesus. Call Homeland Security."
WALT,"Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse, but our --"
SKYLER,Yes.  I would like you both to be there.  Please.
JESSE,"Turned out that the, um, the cancer, had spread to her brain and that was why.  It, um, metastasized.  But it was good that was when we decided to, you know, take her to the doctor ‘cause then we knew what was up.  You know, got her some treatment.  Meds."
WALT,Uh... yes.  Okay... okay.  I’ll be there.
JESSE,"I mean, literally.  It’s-it’s so gross.  They have to LICK his JUNK. I-I-I can’t believe they even showed it on TV."
HANK,See it?
MIKE,"Have a seat, Walter."
JESSE,"Hey, yo, yo!  Yo, you got champagne?  None of that cheap stuff.  I want the expensive shit."
JESSE,"So, what do we do?"
SKYLER,"Uh, yes I do.  I have... concerns."
SKYLER,Hey.
SKYLER,Walt... no.
MARIE,"Wow.  He gives you all this time off, and now this?  Get me a job there."
WALT,Yeah.
WALT,"They’ve got me at the laundry and they’re gonna kill me.  Jesse, do it now!  Do it fast.  Do it, Jesse. Do it!"
SKYLER,"...he realized that the casinos report your winnings to the IRS. And if it gets reported, your family might find out, and if you do not want your family to find out... then you find another place to gamble.  Like an illegal, backroom game.  You remember all those “long walks” that Walt used to take?  All that time he used spend away from home?"
MARIE,And you made one mistake --
WALT,"That’s two.  Alright, let’s close it up."
WALT,... And if they ever found out...
WALT,"But you have to work to get it. You have to turn it into cash. This money?  This you get for doing nothing.  What I’m offering you is right here, right now."
SKYLER,He’s actually a nice guy.  He doesn’t push.
SKYLER,"No, I’m fine."
WALT,Then where are we going to work?
SKYLER,Wait.  Take the Talking Pillow.
HANK,... Where you headed?
SAUL,Yeah.
HANK,"Well, I don’t need one if I’ve got probable cause, counselor."
JESSE,"‘Cause he’s a DUMBASS, that’s why. Ohh... god."
WALT,"I’m quite well, thank you."
WALT,I’ve got two already.
SAUL,“Jesse-Pinkman-In-The-Phone-Book”
SAUL,"Well, let’s brainstorm."
WALT,And it is.  It will be.
SKYLER,Three.  Six hours’ notice.
MARIE,Yeah.
MIKE,"Saul, don’t make me beat you till your legs don’t work.  Now tell me where to find him."
WALT,No!  Jack!  No!
SKYLER,"Later, Ted.  Not now."
HANK,Jesus.  You sure the cancer hasn’t metamorphosized to Walt’s brain?
JESSE,"Hang on, can’t you just -- we gotta hash this out!  Hey!"
WALT,One issue which troubles me.  I don’t know what happens when our three month contract ends.
WALT,"Good.  That’s good.  The uh, the rehab..?  It helped?"
MARIE,"Well, I just heard about a certain patient... named Schrader-comma- Hank..."
HANK,"They’re recreational vehicles, Marie, that’s what they do."
GUS,Wait outside.
GUS,How is your brother-in-law?
JESSE,We gotta do it again.
WALT JR,"Yeah, sure.  Alright, seeya, Dad."
JESSE,"What, I can’t work a scale now?"
HANK,Nah.
JESSE,You’re telling me you’re cooking again? --
SAUL,"So.  Walt tells me that you have, uh, some concerns I can alleviate."
JESSE,"No, no, no, no. Nah.. •"
JESSE,"What are we, running a charity?! C’mon man, we’re gonna take it out!"
HANK,Muscle memory.
JESSE,And that’s not psycho to you.
GUS,What can I do for you?
SKYLER,"Hey, Walt, it’s me.  Just thought I’d try you again.  We’re just wondering what time you think you might be back.  Give us a call and let us know, okay?"
JESSE,"It’s ridiculous?  What, so you’re saying it’s not gonna work?  How about back when it was YOUR plan? Back when we were gonna use it on Tuco?"
WALT,"No.  That...  No, no...  That was the moment.  That night.  I should never have left home.  Never gone to your house.  Maybe things woulda..."
WALT JR,Stop it!  Stop!  Stop it!
WALT,... what is?
WALT,Hank?  Do you think I might get to go inside?  See the lab?
MARIE,"Hank, this isn’t about the insurance.  I’ve talked to everybody -- and they all say that you are healthy enough to go home."
SKYLER,"Um, if we’re going to go down this road... and clearly we are, for the sake of my brother-in-law..."
HANK,Fine.  You want your warrant?  I’ll have my guys bring it and deliver it to you on a little satin pillow. How’s that?
HANK,"Well, three cheers for me."
MARIE,Good!  We’re good.  How are you?
JESSE,Yeah.  That was before I found out you got a kid.  What kind of mother are you?
SKYLER,Who else would we trust?
JESSE,We can do better.
WALT,"Yes, it’s ours.  Now put it away. What the hell is wrong with you?"
MARIE,Flynn.  Hey.
HANK,"Ah, here we go.  Finally."
SAUL,"Well... next time plan for it, wouldja?!  The Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button!  I’m just saying."
HANK,Why not?
JESSE,Yeah?
WALT,So who are you?
JESSE,"Yo, so... what’s next?"
JESSE,Let’s kick it back into gear. Alright?  Let’s start slingin’ again.
MARIE,"They’re gonna start coming in weekly like that, so..."
JESSE,"I ain’t buying no damn nail salon, so just forget it!"
SKYLER,"This isn’t some game, Marie!  This is my husband’s life we’re talking about!  Why are you trying to sabotage us?!"
JESSE,"Just try and stop me, bitch! --"
SKYLER,#NAME?
SKYLER,"Well... no... I don’t pretend to understand, you know, all the details, but he was convinced that if he put enough money into it, he’d have a, um... uh --"
WALT,"Family or no, you let that sink in."
JESSE,Stands in the way of what?
JESSE,Told ya.  Dude’s totally boning us.
SKYLER,Of course!  But you know Walt -- he’s like a brick wall.  He doesn’t talk about his feelings.  Right now we’re barely on speaking terms.
MARIE,"Hi, Sweetie."
JESSE,Maybe later.
SAUL,Is that you talking... or Yoko Ono?
JESSE,It’s not right.
GUS,You vouched for him previously.  I took you at your word.
GUS,Your medical condition.  Has it grown worse?
JESSE,"Uh, yeah, no -- I think you’re good."
MARIE,You’ll be just as comfortable at home as you are here.  You’ll have all the same equipment.
HANK,I’m alright.
WALT,I’m... I understand.  I’m fine.
WALT JR,I have homework to do.
JESSE,"You can’t “order” shit, Adolf, alright?  We’re 50/50 partners, remember?"
WALT,"Yeah, well, you know best, right? Anything else?"
JESSE,Uuuuhh...  Christ!
SAUL,"Gentlemen.  If we could come to some accommodation here, now. There’s always a way to oil everyone’s lock."
SAUL,Do NOT touch anything on my desk.
WALT JR,Thank you.
MARIE,Did you find it?  The RV?
WALT JR,That’s what I said!
MARIE,I thought that Elliot and Gretchen paid for your treatment.
WALT,Yeah..?
MARIE,Ooo...  From the US Attorney in Santa Fe!  Very nice!
SAUL,Makes more sense than you two being together!  I’m still trying to figure out how that happened...
JESSE,No.
HANK,"I’m serious.  Call the FBI, see if he’s legal.  Might not be.  Ship his ass back to Camel-Land."
SKYLER,What is “Ice Station Zebra Associates?”
JESSE,OWWW!  GAH -- what is your PROBLEM?
JESSE,I own it.
WALT,Nine AM Saturday.
JESSE,Since when?
JESSE,Wait.  Tell me you didn’t buy all this from one single goddamn store.
SAUL,There it is.
MARIE,"It’s time to go home, Hank."
HANK,"Uhh, okay -- well --"
HANK,"I know, I know -- a condo in Georgetown, I know."
WALT,"Let me stop you right there, okay? You are not responsible for that. Not in any way, shape or form.  I am up to date on this thing -- probably far more so than you -- and there were a lot of factors at play there."
JESSE,Alright.  Definitely scared him. He’ll probably stay out of the way...
MIKE,Licensed?  Dependable?
SKYLER,You’re a drug dealer.
GUS,Has your condition worsened?
MARIE,"Hey, Flynn!  How’s tricks?"
JESSE,"What about, um, evaporation?"
JESSE,"I gotta pay taxes now?  What the hell’s up with that?!  That’s messed up, yo.  That’s Kafkaesque."
JESSE,You think this’ll stop me from cooking?!
HANK,"Girls, girls!  Cool it, alright? We’re supposed to be talking about"
JESSE,"Trust you?!  Trust you?  That- that’s a good one, yeah.  Yeah, that’s what I’m gonna do."
JESSE,I cook in one of those.  A big one.
WALT,Sonofa --
GUS,Would you take a drive with me?
GUS,You’d need a new assistant.
SAUL,Fourteen’s fair.
WALT,I can’t just quit.    I have a... something of a contract.
WALT,"No.  Thank you.  Let’s, please, let’s change the subject."
WALT,Yeah. How bout: that.?
MIKE,"Laredo, looks like."
HANK,Alright.  See you over there.
JESSE,Go easy.
GUS,I heard about it.  He should have let me take care of them.
WALT,"Yeah, I-I’ll be right there!"
WALT,Jesse. Jesse...
HANK,Ah hah-hah.  Sit and spin.
HANK,Whatcha looking at?
HANK,"I’m not at my best here, Marie..."
SKYLER,#NAME?
MIKE,"Now, I realize you two have a history, but this kid’s been on the bubble a while now.  It’s a long time comin’."
GUS,Why?  They’re doing nothing wrong.
MARIE,"The... equipment.  That you have here, that you need.  Short-term. You’ll do your p.t. at home, and it’ll be great.  Because you’ll be home."
MARIE,Boss hall of fame.  I don’t see anything here from Kleinman -- they’re gonna have to get on the stick.
MARIE,Isn’t that fantastic?
GUS,You’ll have to.  The decision isn’t yours to make.
WALT,You said no half measures.
MARIE,No.  Horses.  Arabian stallions.
JESSE,"Ah, man."
JESSE,"Just go there!  Go to his house and get it.  No one knew about it -- just me and his partner -- no one else knows, I swear!"
HANK,"Look Buddy, why don’t you just go out --"
SKYLER,A system for counting cards in Blackjack.
WALT,What’s that sound?
GUS,I have an offer that I think will interest you.
SKYLER,What about me?
WALT,“Cow-house?”
HANK,"Yeah, well, I needed some time here ‘cause I’m deep into this investigation and I couldn’t do both so I made a judgement call."
WALT,I’m “comforting.”  I’m a comforting presence.
SAUL,"What am I, eighth-grade hall monitor?  “Current whereabouts?” Lemme tell you something --"
SKYLER,#NAME?
JESSE,Yeah.
JESSE,"So, he’s their boy, huh?"
JESSE,"Okay, so... the universe took her to a door.  She got all obsessed with it and just had to paint it twenty times until it was perfect."
SKYLER,Where do you have in mind?
WALT,"I told you, Skyler, I warned you for a solid year -- cross me and there’d be consequences.  Now what didn’t you understand about that?"
HANK,Could you check again?
WALT,I’ll do that.
WALT JR,Not--me!  I want--bacon!
SKYLER,"But, how do I know that?  I mean, apparently you can’t even tell me the man’s name."
WALT,Uh... why?
HANK,"Look, buddy.  I know I don’t tell you often enough, but... I care about you... a helluva lot.  And... this whole cancer thing... let’s face it, you got dealt a shit hand of cards."
JESSE,Three hundred and twelve thousand?!
WALT,Six nights a week.  You get one night off.
MARIE,Hey there!
JESSE,Tell ‘em you’re busy.
WALT,You sure?  Last thing we need is to get locked out.
JESSE,BOO-YAH!  See?  What I say?
WALT JR,Why not?
WALT,Tuco... wanted to murder us.  These guys... don’t.  Apples and oranges! Do-do I really have to sit here and explain the difference to you?
WALT,This is all the money I have in the world.  You are a drug dealer. Negotiate.
SKYLER,"Let’s talk about this later, Ted, okay?"
MIKE,Because it’s moronic.
JESSE,What?  Mr. White..?
GUS,"Oh, it is.  But specifically, has he ever spoken to you about his health problems?"
JESSE,I’m doing it.  With or without you.
WALT,"It’s more than an assistant. Partners.  We’ll be partners again. Split everything.  Fifty-fifty, just like before."
MARIE,Catch the bad guys?
SAUL,You got your bumper cars over there down the way.  Got your arcade right here -- all the latest video games.  Snack bar’s over there. Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents.  That’s a whole new revenue stream...
HANK,"Who are we talking about, Mrs. Ortega?"
HANK,Aren’t you late for work or something?
SKYLER,"Well, just temporarily.  Only until he could get his things together. That was supposed to be last week, but then came the crash, and..."
JESSE,"Hey, wait.  Here..."
HANK,"People who say “guess what,” and then actually expect you to guess? I hate those people."
GUS,Good.  I’m glad.
SKYLER,To do homework or to play video games?
SKYLER,You wanna take her?
WALT,All set?
MARIE,"Well, um, not to bring up ancient history, but ..."
MARIE,You look nice.
WALT,“Get some air?”  Your answer to “We’re sliding head-first into a massive crap...”
SKYLER,"Apparently, they love you in Canada l"
JESSE,"Over by a pound and a half?  I thought you were all, like, “precise.”"
WALT,"Uh, Saul..."
HANK,I leave this hospital -- when I WALK outta here.  You understand?! And not before.
MIKE,How’s her driving?
MARIE,"Well, I’m sorry!  How am I supposed to help you get over this if you won’t even tell me what Walt DID?"
WALT,I don’t know it.
GUS,May I..?
JESSE,H-Huh. Yeah..
GUS,He’s dying of cancer.
MIKE,You’re a businessman.  The lady out front --
WALT,Two years.
SKYLER,No.  We need to talk.
MARIE,"I almost didn’t come here.  Christ, I barely even know who you are. And I sure as hell don’t know if I can ever trust you again."
SAUL,Can’t you see I’m in conference?
SKYLER,No.
SAUL,"You understand “Get Out of Jail Free” card, right?  I mean, just blink once if you’re following..."
JESSE,"I-I can’t do it, Mr. White.  Like you said, I’m-I’m not a..."
JESSE,"Oh god.  Oh, man.  Oh, I’m so dead."
MARIE,To hell with the plan.
WALT,It’s just basic chemistry.
HANK,Call me when you get this...
SAUL,"My guy’s no dummy, right?  So, I give us maybe twenty-four hours before he figures out that address goes nowhere."
WALT,Hey.
SAUL,Holy Christ.
HANK,He’s just going through a phase.
MARIE,Answer me.  Do you understand?
HANK,You put a hospital bed in my bedroom.
SAUL,Which client?
HANK,How is she..?  What’s her condition?
WALT,Guess I should’ve had breakfast this morning.
WALT,So it-it’s possible?
JESSE,"Yeah, I’ve been crunching numbers, and I don’t gotta be a mathematician to figure out this deal you made is bullshit."
JESSE,"It’s, um, it’s in a... laundromat. It’s totally corporate."
SAUL,"So, where’s the maestro?  He out parking the mini-van?"
WALT,No.
SKYLER,"Sit down, Walt."
HANK,"Yeah.  This is just, this is just sad...  I mean, I really feel sorry for you, Marie, you know, I really do.  It’s just, uh... it’s pathetic."
GUS,Never make the same mistake twice.
JESSE,"Look, I..."
WALT,Shut up and give me a hand here.
SKYLER,When does he start physical therapy?
HANK,Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh... a six?
WALT,"Well... my thinking is, by tapering the phenyl you get a oilier aqueous layer, and hence..."
SKYLER,"Flynn, could you put your seat belt on, please?"
WALT,Pinkman.
HANK,I dunno.
SKYLER,Okay.
SAUL,Laser Tag!  Seven thousand square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernalillo County!
SKYLER,Sure.
WALT,"Honestly, what I do would bore you senseless.  Giant space lasers? Now that sounds cool.  I’ll have to bring it up at our next staff meeting."
SKYLER,Not with that money!  You’d be making us accessories after the fact!
WALT,Pressure.  I’ve turned the ventilation up to keep the outside out.
HANK,... swung at me...
JESSE,"Hey, hey, hey stop marking on my floor, dumbass.  Come on."
WALT JR,What do you mean?
HANK,"I dunno, uh.  Four?"
JESSE,"So it’s, like, not dangerous?"
SKYLER,Get out of here.  Now.
JESSE,Chili P’s my signature!
WALT,"I’ve been to my oncologist, Jesse. Just last week."
SAUL,Uh-huh.
WALT,That truck belong to you?
JESSE,"This is... this is glass grade. You got... Jesus, you got crystals in here a quarter-inch long. Longer.  This is pure glass."
WALT,No... no... no...
WALT,Wanna cook?
MIKE,Is that so?
SAUL,Thirteen.
HANK,So says our snitch.  Says some dude who goes by “Cap’n Cook” lives up to his name in there.  Got himself a three pound flask and keeps it bubbling day and night.  Says he always adds a dash of chili powder.
JESSE,Here.  How ‘bout this?
JESSE,Who’s asking you to?
JESSE,"Yo, Kraze!  How you doin’, my man?"
WALT,We’re a family...
SKYLER,Where were you?
JESSE,"Uh, yeah, right.  Like you DON’T"
SKYLER,That’s a lie.  I um... I do know why.
MARIE,"Oh you know, this and that."
SAUL,"Over and above.  Service-wise, this is over and above.  You and I survive this?  Oh, I’m seriously rethinking my pricing.  Yeah."
JESSE,"Oh, hey.  Sorry..."
HANK,"... For those of you who donT'ht,e ask da e - he's ao ncyors"
WALT JR,What about him?
GUS,I apologize for being so transparent.
WALT,"Uh... okay to use your bathroom, right?"
JESSE,Alls I know is I got HALF the money I’m DUE and you got the rest!
WALT,"Now, murder is not part of your twelve-step program.  This is not some... amends you have to make. What you are talking about here is pointless.  This achieves nothing."
JESSE,Do what?
WALT,Get it.
WALT,For the man who has everything.
WALT,Yeah.
WALT,"Yeah.  Sixty-three fifty-three Juan Tabo, number six.  Got it."
JESSE,"WHAT fly?!  Alright, where the hell IS this fly?  Not like I even seen this thing!  Maybe your “positive pressure” blew it out the door or something!"
HANK,Gomie..?  That you..?
SKYLER,"Walt, I’m in this, and if I’m in it, I’m gonna do it right."
JESSE,Be my guest.
WALT JR,"Hey, Dad?"
MARIE,It’s some low-life degenerate versus you.  Doing the job you’re supposed to!  Why should you be the one who pays?  For doing the right thing?
MARIE,"Hank, what the hell are you talking about?"
SKYLER,You.  This is what you buy.
SAUL,"Sit.  Come on, come on.  Humor me for a second.  Now... you know you need to launder your money, right?"
WALT,Why did you invite me here?
MARIE,"You know what, I’m really beat.  I think I’m gonna take that bath."
JESSE,You’re right.  I don’t know what you’ve been through...
SKYLER,#NAME?
JESSE,How ‘bout we go get some air?
WALT,"Damn it!  Come on!  Come on, come on."
WALT,"But first, I’m curious about this..."
HANK,"Whoa, no heavy lifting.  I got it."
SKYLER,"I mean, he certainly knows we’re separated.  So..."
GUS,Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child?
WALT,So you’re promoting caution here. And you want a believable story.
JESSE,Can I have your chip?  I’m gonna steal your chip.
WALT,Uh.  No thanks though.  Maybe some other time.
JESSE,#NAME?
WALT,... yes?
SKYLER,"Okay, um, about a wine cellar?  I mean, we certainly cannot be expected to live without a wine cellar."
WALT,I could talk about that for hours.
WALT,"Okay?  Like you said, he’s the problem!  He’s ALWAYS been the problem!  Without him -- we would --"
MARIE,"I will go to 48 Hours, I will go to Nightline -- I don’t know if there is a Nightline anymore?  It doesn’t matter -- they will all take it and they will run with it.  Because he’s a hero.  And he’s not going to be in a wheelchair at 43."
SKYLER,They'll probably want me to take your glasses.•
MIKE,You know I haven’t slept since Thursday?  I was out all night cleaning up after you.  I need my sleep.
WALT,"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Belmont Avenue, Ontario, California 91764.  I am of sound mind.  To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt.  I’m speaking now to my family."
SKYLER,Please?  It’s not safe.
WALT,"Hi, Honey, it’s me."
WALT,What’re you doing?
JESSE,"Careful -- it’s fragile.  And it’s a boiling flask, not a beaker."
MARIE,"Oh, my God."
SKYLER,"With all they’re giving him, he’ll sleep till morning."
JESSE,Tell me that ain’t the finest scante you ever laid eyes on.
WALT,Jesse!  Come here!
WALT,Nothing gets spilled.
WALT,"Now, the next order of business is getting you a brand new car seat."
HANK,But sometimes your luck can change. Can’t tell you how many times I started with a shit hand and ended up with a full house.  The key is to hang in there and keep placing your bets.
HANK,Do you have any ideas at all... who might’ve taken it?
JESSE,"Oh, uh, I got the funds."
JESSE,Okay.  15 hours starts... now.
WALT,"No, you don’t.  An Erlenmeyer flask is for general mixing and titration.  You do not apply heat to an Erlenmeyer flask.  That’s what the boiling flask is for. Did you not learn anything in my chemistry class?"
SAUL,"Hey, I may have overstated the, uh power of your face."
JESSE,"So, uh, what do we do?  I mean, do we -- wait, wait -- I mean, shouldn’t we be wearing MASKS?"
JESSE,"I took this, um, vo-tech class in high school.  Woodworking.  I took lots of vo-tech classes, ‘cause it was just a big jerk-off.  But this one time I had this teacher name of, ah... Mr., uh... Mr. Pike."
JESSE,Get off me!
WALT JR,"If all this is true and you knew it... then you’re as bad as him, right?"
WALT,There we go...  Say goodnight...
GUS,What about Pinkman?
SKYLER,"Some guy in Minneapolis.  Fourteen dollars plus shipping -- and I got it at a yard sale for eighty cents. God, I love eBay."
MARIE,He’s a hero!  You don’t deny coverage to a hero!
SKYLER,I’m not asking.  But there must be something you can say.  Isn’t it even worth a try?  Hank is your family.
SKYLER,"Walt.  I swear to you, I didn’t put him up to this."
WALT,That’s right.  He couldn’t.  He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an eleven year-old boy.
SAUL,Final step: integration.  The revenues from the salon go to the owner -- that’s you.
SAUL,"“Wax-on, wax-off” -- was that you?"
WALT,#NAME?
JESSE,"Nothing but cows.  Got some big cow-house way over that way, like two miles.  But I don’t see nobody."
WALT,Gale.  I’m wondering.  How you..?
JESSE,"Look.  Otherwise, you don’t haveta, you don’t gotta lift a finger."
WALT,You’re a drug dealer.  Negotiate.
SKYLER,"Walt, this is a good neighborhood. It’s got a good elementary, and supposedly a very good high school. And believe me, ‘cause I have definitely looked everywhere -- for our price range, this is as good as it gets."
HANK,Could be they’re setting up.  I heard movement inside.
SKYLER,"No!  God, no.  I-no.  God.  I’m just trying to, just talk it through.  That’s..."
MARIE,"I’ve tried, but he’s not answering. I’m sure he’s in the thick of it with your father."
HANK,"Oh, yeah?  Look at these."
SAUL,"Hey, what?  Hey...  Listen to it! Come on!  I’m talking about your future here!  Listen to reason!"
WALT,Please don’t do this.
SKYLER,"God, I know.  Anyway, I certainly wasn’t ready to move us back. But... it’s time.  And we’re driving my sister and her husband up a wall, I’m sure."
WALT,I know we’re not even talking about this.
JESSE,"So, is that your fly saber?"
SKYLER,"Ted, I’m...  I’ll see you in a day or two?  Back at the office?"
MARIE,Have you asked him?
SKYLER,"I don’t want him dicking you around tonight.  You get paid till six, you work till six.  Not seven."
JESSE,Thanks for the toke.
HANK,Yes.  Of course...
JESSE,Yeah.
HANK,"Jesus, whaddya got in this thing? Cinderblocks?"
WALT,I’ll be here with bells on.
MARIE,"So this is good news, right?"
JESSE,"It’s like rigid, all kinds of red tape.  My boss is a dick.  The owner?  Super-dick.  I’m not worthy or whatever to meet him but I guess everybody's scared of the dude."
WALT,Yeah.
WALT,"You say hello to her for me, would you?"
JESSE,"I just, uh, wanted to give you a heads up.  It’s gonna get a little slower smuggling product with, uh, Grandpa Anus watching every move I make."
WALT,"No, no.  It’s not about money... it’s about getting him off the streets.  Getting him to calm down..."
JESSE,"Nah.  Come on, man!  Some straight like you, giant stick up his ass... all a sudden at age, what, fifty he’s just gonna break bad?"
SKYLER,Thank God.
JESSE,El axe-o!  Peligroso!  El axe-o!
WALT,"Either that, or I turn you in."
SKYLER,No.  Your Dad is.
JESSE,"Whatever.  Just have him put in one of those, too."
HANK,I’d really like to speak with him.
HANK,Copy that.  The suspect... might he be of the Latin persuasion?
SKYLER,Yeah.  God knows he went through a lot down there.
WALT JR,Whatever.  I don’t even care anymore.  Can you just give me a ride to school?
SAUL,"Hey look.  Here’s you, right? Pink, Pinkman -- get it?"
HANK,#NAME?
WALT,It... got into the lab!  And I’m trying to get it OUT.  Okay? Understand?
SKYLER,"You’re not the only one this affects, Walt.  What about me and Walter, Jr.?  What about..."
SAUL,"No, that’s seventeen percent."
WALT JR,But I’m good?
WALT JR,How’s what?
WALT,Hey.
HANK,Nah.
WALT,I need you to come inside and pack. Right now.
WALT,What’s up?
WALT JR,Hey.
JESSE,"You tell me.  This is your deal, man.  You wanna smoke it up, smoke it up at your house."
SKYLER,"Come on now, let him speak.  That’s what we’re here for.  Go on, Hank."
WALT,Going back to your apartment?
WALT,Jesus H. Christ.
SKYLER,No.
WALT,What’s the yield?  Hey.
SAUL,Well.  You grow more gorgeous by the minute!
SKYLER,Dinner two nights.  Not weekends. With twenty-four hours’ notice.
WALT,"Look.  I feel like I’m running out of ways to explain this to you... but once more, I will try.  This fly is a major problem for us.  It will ruin our batch.  And we need to destroy it and every trace of it so we can cook.  Failing that? We’re dead.  There is no more room for error.  Not with these people."
WALT,#NAME?
JESSE,‘Cause like...  It’s like...
WALT,Don’t kill him!
WALT,That’s good.  That’s good.
WALT JR,Not so fast...
WALT,"No, don’t."
WALT,What’s up?
MARIE,We’ll see.
HANK,You had my cell phne number?  You had my wife’s name?!
SAUL,Yeah.  You are now owner of this fine establishment.
SKYLER,Hey!  Wh... what are you doing here?
SKYLER,Sweetie... what is it?  C’mon...
WALT,Yes.  Slow!  Move slowly...
JESSE,This doesn’t stay more than a day.
WALT,LISTEN TO ME!  Go to your room RIGHT NOW and grab whatever’s important.
SKYLER,"I don’t know, Walt.  Will you tell me?"
GUS,Why did you make these decisions?
JESSE,"Whatever, man.  You owe me that money!"
JESSE,"And the head hyena, he’s the MAN, you know.  All the other ones have to like, kiss his ass."
JESSE,"You’re not how I remember you from class.  I mean, like, not at all."
SAUL,Lemme talk to him.
SKYLER,"No, it’s not.  He’s gonna love it."
JESSE,"Look, I definitely got it, man, alright..."
HANK,... like that.
WALT,Doesn’t matter.  This doesn’t concern you.
SKYLER,"Yeah.  Holly here, and a son in high school -- Walter, Junior."
WALT,Let go.  Let... GO!
WALT JR,Eeewww...
HANK,Hey Janice?  Janice!
WALT,"Yeah, as a high school teacher. Can’t even remember the last time I set foot in a real lab.  I’ve been out of the loop for twenty years."
WALT,"I am at least going to be a part of this household.  Dinner with the family, every night of the week."
JESSE,Two-oh-one point six.
SKYLER,And he can’t get you another Danny to run the car wash.
JESSE,"I dunno.  Maybe it was the way he said it.  But...  Like he wasn’t exactly sayin’ it sucked -- he was just askin’ me honestly, Is that all you got?  And... for some reason, I thought to myself Yeah, man... I can do better."
SKYLER,Whose truck is that?
HANK,"Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie."
SAUL,Twelve for old time’s sake. Twelve.
WALT,Yeah.  I see you.
WALT,Yeah.
WALT,Anyone watching the place?
WALT,Please tell me you found him.
JESSE,"Hey.  Tick-tock, yo."
WALT,"Well, don’t keep me waiting."
WALT,Why?
JESSE,"What I look like, his shadow?  Who cares where he’s at?  What am I doing here?"
MARIE,It’s all gonna work out.  You’ve been too good to them for too many years.
JESSE,"Hey, ‘sup."
WALT,"Hey, Margaret."
WALT,Life and death.
SKYLER,Did you win the lottery and not tell me?
WALT,Alright.  It’s a deal.
WALT,"I couldn’t chance saying it inside. For all I know, the lab’s wired for sound."
SKYLER,Are you safe?
JESSE,"You don’t got, like, eight more anal things we gotta do first?"
MIKE,No... no...
SAUL,"Wait, wait, wait!  Hey!  Ladies, thank you, good job.  Come back here."
MIKE,I’m looking to find a client of yours.  I was hoping you could help me out with an address.
GUS,Please.
WALT,"Hank, you could just... cut to the chase."
WALT,Spillage?
JESSE,"You like that?  That’s science and stuff, makes it do that."
SKYLER,"After the first trimester, yes."
WALT JR,What?!
JESSE,"Wait, whoa... what?  You said the kid is coming home..."
WALT,How about something with playing cards in the spokes?  Makes a nice motor-y sound.
MARIE,Hey -- I wasn’t planning on agreeing with Walt.  But after hearing all of you talk about his future like he doesn’t even have a say in it --
JESSE,But it did.  No thanks to you...
MARIE,"Yes.  It happens all the time. Years of training, and your body acted faster than your brain, you had no choice but to hit him, you had to fight back --"
WALT,Yes.  Statistical... um.
WALT,I was curious.
JESSE,What happened..?
SAUL,"You’re now officially the ‘cute one’ of the group.  Paul, meet Ringo.  Ringo... Paul."
MIKE,"I’ll bet he’d come running -- BOOM,"
HANK,"Well, then, I’m curious as to why the theft was never reported.  I’m not seeing any record of it with the police or the DMV."
HANK,"Welded onto the back of a house. Well, that’s classy.  Christ. Okay.  Thanks."
SKYLER,Hello.
MIKE,Let’s both get comfortable.
WALT,You weren’t supposed to be here!
WALT,Hi.
SAUL,Gimme the phone.  Give it.
WALT,Hello.
JESSE,"Hey, you know what?  I have magical powers.  You wanna see?  Ready?"
WALT,How you holding up?
WALT,Take it.  It belongs to you.
GUS,"Explain to me -- why this man White?  He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes... but he’s not the one who murdered him."
MARIE,It’s probably still on lock-out.
SKYLER,I know youre not. I asked her.
WALT,"Jesse. c'mon, help me out."
MARIE,"How could you do that to her, Walt?"
WALT,I’m okay.  Really.
JESSE,TOTALLY.  Uhn!  God.
JESSE,What do you mean?
HANK,"Oh, hey!  Turn it up!"
JESSE,Hello?
SKYLER,"I mean -- I, personally, feel that the decision you’re making is not in the best interest of our family unit.  In my opinion."
SAUL,You’re so sure.
JESSE,Y’know what?  Escalate this.
WALT,"Ah.  But I’m noting a little hole in your plot, though.  Why would your “estranged” husband be doing all this for you?"
JESSE,"Okay so, these guys using kids like that?  They gotta go.  Right?"
MIKE,My boss.
SKYLER,Walt?  We can always pay their bills.
WALT,“Thought anymore” meaning “reconsidered?”  No.
JESSE,You want me to get it?
SAUL,"what do I look like, the RV disposal people?  Did you not plan for this contingency?"
SKYLER,"Because he loves his family and desperately wants a reconciliation. Though it may be hopeless and futile... then again, he’d try anything."
JESSE,What the hell is that?
SKYLER,"Me, too."
SAUL,"Yeah, and if you want to stay a criminal and not become -- say, a convict -- then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer."
JESSE,Two-oh-one point eight.
SAUL,"Whoa-whoa Walt.  Hold on there! Hey.  What was the offer, if I may ask?"
JESSE,"Yeah, well we’ll see about that."
SKYLER,"Marie, I’ve got nothing to say."
WALT,"That’s what you wanted, right?"
WALT,Yes.  I understand.
MARIE,I squeezed some orange juice.  You want a glass of orange juice?
GUS,So we try to clean them every night.  But make sure it’s off before you open the intake valve...
WALT,"No, I uh... nah."
SKYLER,Actually -- she asked the doctor.
WALT JR,"Hey Dad, it’s me."
SKYLER,I don’t know what to do.  I can’t believe he could be so stubborn -- and stupid.  Why would anyone in their right mind choose not to get treatment when it’s completely paid for?  Why would he do this to us?
HANK,I’m just not the man I thought I was.  I think I’m done as a cop.
MARIE,Everything changes now -- and you’ve got to prepare yourself.
JESSE,One teenth?!  That’s it?
WALT,Same time.
JESSE,"‘Sup?  Brock, huh.  That’s a cool name.  Here.  Give it up..."
WALT JR,Why won’t you tell me what’s --
SKYLER,"Well, I think this is um... we should probably table this discussion for later.  Your Dad and I have a couple things to talk about, so..."
WALT,"Oh, you’re never going to see Hank again.  He crossed me.  You think about that."
WALT,We ship it as-is.
SAUL,That’s a joke.  The kid ain’t coming.
WALT,"Excellent.  That’s very good, Jesse.  That’s excellent."
MARIE,Seeing what I see.
WALT JR,Who said anything about God?  It was some stupid air traffic controller! --
SKYLER,I can never find anything in this Buick.
SAUL,"I’ve heard about him.  Uh, he’s an American hero."
SKYLER,Whose loan-out?
GUS,I had excellent help.  As will you.
HANK,"So, um.  Where do we go from here?"
WALT,It’s a stupid present...
HANK,#NAME?
JESSE,"It’s not for you, dipshit -- it’s for our customers.  And they’re gonna demand a certain standard. That stuff just didn’t cut it."
WALT,"Look, Skyler, I don’t know what kind of relationship you picture me having with this person --"
SKYLER,"Hi, I hope we’re not too late."
WALT,"I don’t mean “jail” as in, jail jail.  I’m talking about one of those... situations where you’re in an orange jumpsuit, picking up litter along the highway."
SKYLER,A “warning call?”  What do you mean?
GUS,Some worthless junkie.  For him you “intervene” and put us all at risk. Some contemptible junkie who couldn’t keep the peace for eight hours.
MIKE,Huh.  I learn all kinds of things being with you.
SKYLER,Okay what?
SKYLER,"So, he put his mind to it, and uh... well, you know how Walt is, he’s-he’s a problem solver.  And he read books and he did a whole bunch of research... and he came up with this system."
SKYLER,What’s going on down there? Is he asleep?
HANK,"Yeah, that’s correct."
JESSE,This is bullshit.  Just say it. Just say the words.  You think I’m stealing?!
JESSE,Hey.  It’s me.  Wait for the thing.
SKYLER,Damned if I know.  I described it as a “mid-century objet d’art.”
MARIE,"Easy for you to say -- you’re not the one who has to do it.  I’m a medical professional -- I see people in this situation all the time.  Some of them don’t want to spend their last months dying slowly in a hospital, picked over by doctors -- unable to get out of bed or go to the bathroom by themselves.  Is that really what you want for Walt?"
WALT,“How could you have known that they were THERE before you took off the tape?”  Say it!  Say it!
WALT JR,He’s still here.  He’s in the house.
SKYLER,Go ahead.  Tell your dad how you feel.
SKYLER,Don’t get ‘em if they’re too tight.
JESSE,These chemicals are poisonous.
HANK,... a pipe...
JESSE,Yo.
JESSE,It’s not what I want.
HANK,Nothing’s gonna happen.
WALT JR,Um... are my feet okay?
WALT,"Alright, bring it down.  Ready? Okay, we’re good."
JESSE,#NAME?
WALT,I mean a fly.  A housefly.
SKYLER,What?!
JESSE,Yeah.  Thanks.
WALT JR,So which means pick me up about 8:30..?
GUS,That is very much the question.
SKYLER,How was your day?
JESSE,"This is the key.  We combine this with hydriodic acid and your pseudo, cook it, and -- voila -- freebase meth oil."
SKYLER,Wh-what’s a “Danny?”
JESSE,What about contamination?
JESSE,"High?  What, for our stuff?! That’s what I was getting!  Okay, look, say he’s getting forty a pound, alright, two hundred pounds a week for three months..."
SKYLER,"Ted, this has gotta be the most amazing invention ever."
JESSE,Hey!  Yo!
JESSE,"No, man.  Not really.  I can’t say as I’m really following you here."
MARIE,No.  Just remind me to bring his from home.
JESSE,"Andrea, right?"
MARIE,I wanna be there in case he wakes up.
JESSE,"Hey.  Um, my name’s Jesse, and, uh..."
SKYLER,#NAME?
HANK,"I mean, it’s a -- it’s a great way to get the family together for an affordable vacation.  Must’ve been quite a blow when it went missing."
WALT,Just move your jaw around.  Move it around.
WALT JR,“Yell”.
WALT JR,We were wondering if you could do us a favor and buy us a six of Bud Light.  We forgot our ID’s.
HANK,"Alright.  I’ll tell you what, we’re gonna check out a couple more, then call it a morning.  Okay, whaddaya say?"
WALT,"Okay.  Now, on three."
WALT,Hank?  How much money is that?
MARIE,I’m just seeing.
MIKE,Give me a hug.  I see your Mom. Don’t keep her waiting.
MARIE,It’s over.
JESSE,Get us a couple of flunkies in here.  Treat us right.
JESSE,Good?
JESSE,Sorry for what?  Being a lunatic?
SKYLER,"Hank, he just wants to be supportive--"
MARIE,What’s up with Walt lately?
WALT,No?
WALT,"Hank, work with me here.  Tell us you’ll let this drop."
MARIE,Hey...
SKYLER,"So, as you can see, there’s a kinda flow going on here.  It’s a nice big living room.  And this is the, um, dining area."
MARIE,You tell him or I will.  There’s no way around it.  He has to know and he has to know now.
JESSE,"You either run from things or you face them, Mr. White."
WALT JR,"Oh--damn!  Hell, yeah!"
JESSE,"That’s what James Bond drinks, mofos.  I’m all about that."
GUS,I told you before.  You will not kill Walter White.  Not until my business with him has concluded.
SAUL,"Okay.  Yeah... what exactly does “knows about” mean?  Does he have it, has he searched it --"
WALT,"Hi.  You’re my new lab assistant, I take it."
JESSE,"Look, I like making cherry product, but let’s keep it real, alright: we make POISON for people who DON’T CARE.  Alright?  We probably have the most UN-PICKY customers in the world."
HANK,"Marie, what is wrong with you?"
WALT,"Alright, ionic bonds.  Chapter six."
SKYLER,You want me to go ask for another?
WALT,Jesse... Jesse.
WALT,Chemicals.  No.  Change.  Chemistry is the study of change.
MARIE,"You can do this, Hank."
SKYLER,What?
GUS,How do you mean?
SAUL,Ten percent of all future profits from his solo venture.  That’s money you get paid for simply walking down to the mailbox! --
JESSE,You know it was Jane’s Dad who accidentally crashed them together? ‘Cause he was so torn up?
SAUL,I’ll call my P.I.
HANK,"You know what?  If it’ll get you outta here quicker, you’ve got one minute."
SAUL,"Danny runs the Laser Tag.  Danny is the guy who had a vision.  Where others saw a dirt lot, he saw black lights, rubber aliens, teenagers running around with ray guns, right?  He was like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.  And when the stock market took a shit and Danny got in trouble, he went searching for exactly the type of situation that we’re offering.  Okay, Danny will look the other way to keep his dream afloat.  In other words, Danny can be trusted.  Completely."
JESSE,You -- wanna cook crystal meth.
HANK,“All the same equipment?”  What the hell does that mean?
JESSE,What are you talking about?
JESSE,I heard you say five -- you said it right in front of me!
WALT,"Uh.  T-Thank you, I..."
JESSE,"Any other doors here we can check out?  Like, real ones, or...?"
WALT,What in god’s name is a Danny?
JESSE,I didn’t take shit.
MARIE,"Sky?  We got our first bill.  And, you know, if you’re still insistent..."
MIKE,Well.  They didn’t find any.
GUS,That’s very interesting.
WALT,An invitation.
GUS,"Well, that’s the best way to do business."
WALT JR,Aunt Marie’s coming to dinner?
SAUL,"Jesus.  Plan A, then.  Go!  Get to it before the feds do!"
MIKE,"I dunno, Walt.  It’s what I do, after all."
HANK,Wanna come meet a bad guy?
JESSE,"Hey.  You got a kid, right?  What’s his name?"
WALT JR,I looked it up -- New Mexico says all I need is a note from a doctor.
JESSE,"Hey, Martin."
SKYLER,I know you’re scared.  But you’re not alone.  We are gonna be there with you every step of the way.
WALT,I’ll give you Jesse Pinkman! --
SKYLER,"Tell him, not me."
SKYLER,I want you gone by Monday morning.
JESSE,Not like any vagina I ever saw.
MARIE,One minute?  Alright.  That’s a cakewalk.
JESSE,"Oh well, in that case I’ll only have two.  And-and I want the tall, skinny glasses.  I like those skinny glasses."
HANK,"Gomie!  Time for the little bird to fly the nest, huh?"
JESSE,I know a woman who buys from these two once or twice a week.  Alright?
MARIE,I will.
WALT,"This is punitive, is what this is! We are happily married!  I --"
JESSE,"Hey, they gotta go, alright?  I got the entire thing figured out."
JESSE,Hey.  It’s me.  Wait for the thing.
JESSE,You take cream and sugar?
JESSE,"Mr. White, I understand that the fly is a serious thing now, alright.  I’m onboard.  I’m just saying, you know, maybe if we went and got some air, it would help us come up with a plan on how to catch it.  Then come back down here and subtract his ass."
SKYLER,Okay.
MIKE,I’m making inquiries.
SKYLER,"Not every night, no."
HANK,You’re okay..?
SKYLER,"Okay.  Stan, this is my husband Walt."
WALT,"Ah, the dining “area.”  Right."
HANK,"What?  You leave your balls in your wife’s purse, or what?"
WALT JR,What the hell is going on?!
GUS,"Ah, Walter.  You’re right on time. Please... come in."
MARIE,I think you should do whatever you want to do.
SKYLER,#NAME?
HANK,"Walt, just say the word and I’ll take you on a ride-along.  You can watch us knock down a meth lab."
WALT,Maybe.
WALT,There you have it.
WALT JR,"Doesn’t matter -- it’s a provisional.  Look it up!  They changed the law like, ten years ago."
HANK,You sure?  Happy to do it.
WALT,I was thinking it might be nice to have a little family time this weekend.
HANK,Yeah.  Who’s this?
WALT,Nobody’s looking for you.
SKYLER,"So, show me the flaw in it."
HANK,Schrader.
WALT,I’m the one who’s sick --
HANK,Come again?
JESSE,"Not this.  If the cops catch me, I give them what they want most."
WALT JR,"Dad, get off her!  Stop it!"
WALT,Are they here now?
WALT,Yeo You tell me lyx u ia
JESSE,"Yeah, yeah, yeah -- million and a half each, whoop-de-doo.  What’s he getting?  Huh?!"
MARIE,Well...
JESSE,"Talk to my lawyer, alright?  Hey, you hear me?  I got nuthin’ to say."
WALT,I am... awake.
HANK,"Don’t you have any friends?  I mean, Jesus.  Find something better to do!  I don’t need everyone staring at me hangin’ here like a camel’s ball sac."
JESSE,What’re you bringing that for?
JESSE,This is mine just as much as yours! You don’t get to just -- just --
MARIE,I would like --
MIKE,Gonna need you to come with me.
MARIE,We were just having some wine. Would you like a glass?
SKYLER,-- He’s not gonna have a future if he doesn’t get the treatment!
WALT,"I was there and I watched her die. I watched her overdose and choke to death.  I could’ve saved her, but I didn’t."
SKYLER,You tell me.
JESSE,"You don’t give a shit about me! You said I was NO GOOD!  I’m NOTH- ING!  Why would you want ME, huh? You said my meth is ‘inferior,’ right, right?  Hey!  You said my cook was garbage?!  Screw you, man! Screw you!"
GUS,"Walter.  I would like to help you, if I could."
WALT JR,"Yes, sir."
JESSE,Dickhead.
HANK,"Somebody take this, please."
SKYLER,"Um, Walt says he’s not going anywhere."
SKYLER,Me.  I’ll be the Danny.
WALT,I know the moment.
JESSE,"Mr. White, how about you just sit down?"
JESSE,What?  This?
JESSE,Must be Thailand-hot up there. That’s why he likes it.
SKYLER,"Oh, Marie..."
SKYLER,Why don’t you go get your dad.
WALT,"Listen, we’ve got a problem.  A DEA problem!"
WALT,I don’t suppose you just came by to insult me.
GUS,Enjoy your meal.
MARIE,Alright.  So when do we get him walking again?
JESSE,"I know what you’re thinking.  But trust me, it’s not gonna be like it was.  Never gonna be like it was."
SKYLER,"We have to go, Walt."
WALT,"You know, still unpacking.  Finding places for everything."
WALT JR,Dad!
HANK,"Okay, Walt, look at it this way. It’s the bottom of the ninth, bases loaded.  You’re up.  But you got a bum arm -- and you know you can’t hit a homer.  So you can either let the pinch hitter take the bat, or you can hold onto your pride and lose the game.  You get what I’m sayin’?"
MIKE,Where is she?
JESSE,"You ain’t “Welcome Back, Kotter,” so step off.  No speeches."
SKYLER,"Y’know, I’m a bookkeeper -- so I actually, I know what money laundering is."
SKYLER,"Do you have any thought about how we’re going to approach this with Walter, Jr?"
JESSE,Whatever.  Later.
WALT,... That would’ve been perfect.
WALT,"Hanodneay,nswweer'veed. been over this. Asked"
WALT,Our RV.  The one which contains a meth lab?  Which is covered with my fingerprints?!  Ring a bell?
GUS,"I’d like you to hear my offer, notwithstanding."
JESSE,"You know what?  That meth-head stood up to your brother-in-law, alright?  He questioned her five hours and she didn’t give it up. You know how it is you know it? ‘Cause you’re not in prison right now!"
JESSE,"Uh, yeah.  It was."
JESSE,"Little, maybe."
MARIE,"You had me at cheese sticks. You're gonna have to fight me for those, Hank!"
JESSE,"Alright, see ya tomorrow."
SKYLER,What legitimate reasons could there possibly be?
JESSE,"That’s charity, is what that is.  I do all the work, he sits around on his fat ass judging people --"
SKYLER,I’m fine.  Thanks.
MARIE,I’m sure he has his reasons.
GUS,"When you have children, you always have family.  They will always be your priority.  Your responsibility.  And a man..?  A man provides.  And he does it even when he’s not appreciated... or respected... or even loved.  He simply bears up, and he does it. Because he’s a man."
WALT JR,"Dad, just stop and talk to me! Please!"
JESSE,"Need some juice, maybe?"
WALT,A fly.
SKYLER,"And oh, there’s uh, a breakfast bar kinda dealie here, which is nice. And um, the kitchen’s really spacious, and you know... got good appliances, and"
SAUL,"Is this a secure..?  Yes, what’s with the..?"
JESSE,No freakin’ clue.
WALT,You can take your mask off now.
SKYLER,So all this is to say... we have the money.
WALT,Skyler.  Put it down.  Please. We’ll figure everything out...
JESSE,"No.  You flunked me, remember? Prick?  And let me tell you something else -- this shit ain’t chemistry.  This shit is art. Cooking is art.  The shit I cook is the bomb, so don’t be telling me!"
SAUL,"Based on her years of experience in money laundering, I suppose."
SKYLER,Anyway.  This system of his -- he finally got it to work.
SKYLER,"Marie, you will take our money. Use it to take care of Hank."
WALT,Three million.
JESSE,I’m the bad guy.
SKYLER,"If you’re gonna launder money Walt, at least do it right."
MARIE,"Mostly fine, okay...  Well there’s a ringing endorsement."
JESSE,"Acceptable?  Every jibbhead from here to Timbuktu’s gonna want a taste!  It’s gonna be like, “Sir, would you care to replace your Schwinn bicycle with this brand-new Ferrari?”  Shit!"
MARIE,"It’s like something’s eating him away from inside.  He’s just not the same.  He’s not.  Facing death, it changes a person.  It has to. Don’t you think?"
MARIE,A system.
JESSE,You..?
SAUL,"Okay, so, what?  We pay him off."
SKYLER,Hank.  What about him?
SAUL,Or on a... scratch piece of paper... somewhere...
GUS,"Three million for three months, that was our agreement.  Extended annually, twelve million a year."
WALT,Five.
SKYLER,#NAME?
JESSE,Were you here all night?
JESSE,"It’s cloudy.  It’s not s’posed to be cloudy.  The last time, it was glass.  It sparkled like diamonds."
WALT JR,"C’mon, Uncle Hank.  You can do it. How else are you gonna get out of here?"
SKYLER,Three.  Told you.  They’re all pretty good size.
JESSE,"Huh?  See?  Crystal so big, look like somebody broke a window. Look like you’d cut your nose off. Try it."
HANK,Seeing what?
JESSE,"Don’t sweat it, alright, you’re just doing what you do.  Hey, nobody’s gonna know anything."
JESSE,"No, man."
SAUL,"This is the nail salon, right?  I take your dirty money and I slip it into this salon’s nice, clean cash flow.  That’s called layering."
JESSE,There’s got to be some other way.
MARIE,I tell you what.  If I can get the groundhog to see his shadow --
WALT,"Well, then, let’s stretch our price range.  Truly.  I mean why... why buy a starter house when we’ll have to move out of in a year or two."
HANK,Can I take back what I said before? I agree with Marie.  Walt wants to die like a man!
SAUL,I’m a reasonable guy.  It’s a short term deal.  Ten even.  But I can’t go any lower and still respect myself.
GUS,"Okay, let’s put this pepper here..."
WALT JR,"No.  Uh, I don’t think either of them are working right now."
SAUL,"Come on, I gotta cheer you up."
JESSE,"Come on, man, I told you where to find the tape!"
WALT,Is this a secure line??
JESSE,"It’s just basic chemistry, yo.  So you got something for me?"
SKYLER,"Um, I really gotta head home."
GUS,May I take this as a “yes?”
WALT,I wouldn’t know.
WALT,"Anyway... So, anyway... he’s insisting that I..."
WALT,Yeah.  Let’s see... how shall I put this?  I’m in.  You’re out.
MIKE,Is that right?
SKYLER,You took my child --
MARIE,Prepare yourself.
GUS,I understand that you have a problem with two of my employees.
WALT,Seriously -- you’re... this is a bad idea.
JESSE,Yeah.  Totally Kafkaesque.
HANK,Okay?
SKYLER,It’s the truth.
SKYLER,I don’t even know what to say to you.  Go to your room.  I’ll deal with you later.
MARIE,Let ‘em.  I don’t care if someone walks in.
WALT,"Please, Marie.  Let us help."
SKYLER,Why are you here?
SAUL,"What do you think that was in there?  A bluff?  He wants your brother-in-law.  And there’s gonna be a parade of lawyers creaming their Underoos for a case like that.  I mean, I’d take it myself if it wouldn’t cause so much collateral damage."
JESSE,So where are they?
HANK,Hello?
WALT,"Definitely before the surgery.  Oh Christ, that damn second cell phone.  I mean, how could I possibly..?"
WALT,So why don’t we do that?  Take a little break.
MARIE,That’s what Skyler told me.
WALT,"Back when Elliott and I were in grad school, we came up with the name.  Schwartz -- black.  Walter White.  Black and white make gray... Gray Matter Technologies."
JESSE,"No, we’re not gonna cook here. This is my house.  I don’t shit where I eat."
MIKE,"Well... a little.  But he’d probably knock everything over. Plus, there’s that big nose of his."
SKYLER,"I thought maybe, um... there’s a way you could help him."
JESSE,"I am not turning down the MONEY, I am turning down YOU!  YOU GET IT? I want nothing to do with you! Ever since I met you, everything I ever cared about is gone, ruined, turned to SHIT... DEAD!  Ever since I hooked up with the great Heisenberg."
JESSE,"It’s weird, is all.  It doesn’t compute.  If you’re like... crazy or something... if you’ve gone crazy, or depressed.  I’m just saying.  That’s something I need to know about.  That affects me."
GUS,"Three months, then out."
WALT,"Oh,yes, hi.  I-I’m sorry, I’ll uh... I’ll be right down."
HANK,You bet your ass the cavalry’s coming.
GUS,It’s a fancy name for fish stew.
WALT,"I’ve got coffee.  Coffee and tap water.  Beverage-wise, all bases covered.  Coffee with a tap water chaser, perhaps..?"
JESSE,"Don’t think it matters, but, uh..."
SAUL,"All due respect, I don’t see it. So, I vote, I vote no."
SAUL,"Uh, my advice?  That’s probably not a good strategy.  I mean, they’re scared of you right now.  They want nothing to do with you.  But if you hit them, they’re forced to hit back -- hard.  I mean, they will turn over every rock hither, thither and yon until someone spills the beans on you and-and anyone associated with you. Present company included."
WALT,"Well.  Good morning.  I apologize for running a bit late, I uh..."
HANK,"Back when we... lost you?  And I was trying to track you down through your former student, Jesse Pinkman?  Now... YOU know that I know that once upon a time, he may have, uh, dealt you a little weed."
WALT,"Jesse, look, I’m fine.  So why don’t you just please focus on --"
SAUL,"Yeah.  “Attorney-client privilege?” I mean, that’s a big one!  And that’s something I provide for you! So, if I give up Pinkman... well, then you’re gonna be asking “old"
JESSE,You gonna help me or what?
SKYLER,There’s Elliott.  Is he talking to Ali MacGraw?
WALT,"Oh, God.  You led him right to us."
WALT,"...And the desired product is in gas form, so --"
JESSE,I need ricin.
JESSE,"Combo was us, man.  He was one of us.  Does that mean nothing?"
WALT,Quit my part-time job -- I’ve got four hours to devote to this every afternoon.  And...
SKYLER,Walt..?
JESSE,Okay.  Now we’re in business.
HANK,"Janice, I’m, uh, I’m dead in the water here."
JESSE,"Oh, I’m gonna say jack.  I’m gonna say plenty."
JESSE,"I’m gonna go out on a limb and say, uh, yeah."
GUS,"Oh, no... no, thank you.  I’m sorry for the inconvenience --"
WALT,So why are you telling me this?
JESSE,"This isn’t even seven grand, alright.  My guy wants eighty-five."
MIKE,"tIhadto' nt seepaoninyt.sign. But then,"
SKYLER,"That, it seems to me, is the safest way to make the best of a very bad situation, yes."
SKYLER,You’re home early.
GUS,Gale.  It’s good to see you.
SKYLER,Okay
SKYLER,I am.
MARIE,"That’s good, keep talking. Protest.  Struggle."
GUS,Now... the garlic?
HANK,What do we got to drink around here?
JESSE,Whaddya think?
JESSE,I learned it in rehab.  It’s all about accepting who you really are.
JESSE,What if I could get some?
SKYLER,No.  He’s great.
WALT,"All you had to do was mention the Bunsen burner and he’d go off on a rant.  “He didn’t actually invent it, he just improved it.”  Easy way to kill fifteen minutes."
MARIE,Hi.
GUS,"I should have called first.  I’m not interrupting anything, am I?"
JESSE,I’m better.
SKYLER,Bring her back.
HANK,I tried to fight it.  But then... El Paso.  It’s just gotten worse. What I did to Pinkman... that’s not who I’m supposed to be.  That’s not me.  All this...
WALT,"Correct.  I did not.  I was sitting at a stop light, minding my own business, when the man... the-the kid threw a bag of money through my window!"
WALT,"No, no, no, no, no.  We have got to destroy the evidence!  We gotta rig it to burn, wdo you understand?"
WALT,"Jesse, listen to me...  You are not a murderer.  I’m not, and you’re not.  It’s as simple as that."
JESSE,Yeah.  Vestiges.
JESSE,Yeah.
SAUL,Hmm.  I was gonna have you two flip a coin.  Since the genius can’t be bothered...
MARIE,"But you two managed, right?  You said yourself that Elliot and Gretchen’s money didn’t cover everything."
HANK,"Fight the good fight, brother."
WALT,How do these fit?  You like these?
HANK,"You know you’re just, you’re being foolish, you know?  Come on. What’s the point?"
JESSE,"Yeah, he’d, uh... he’d shoot me in the head.  Yeah, he’d shoot me in the head."
HANK,"Hey, Buddy."
HANK,Almost seven hundred thousand. Pretty good haul.
SKYLER,"Tell me what happened.  Where’s Hank?  Please, we need to know."
JESSE,You been following this airplane crash?
SKYLER,"Absolutely not, and I need to keep it that way."
WALT,"Jesse, you are now... 42 minutes late.   I’m starting without you."
JESSE,That’s weird.
HANK,Know your enemy and all.
WALT JR,#NAME?
JESSE,"Hey, you got nothing on me, yo. Alright?  You can call my lawyer."
SKYLER,"Did you try the blinis, with the caviar and the little dab of creme fraiche?  Oh my God.  I must’ve eaten about thirty of those suckers."
SKYLER,#NAME?
JESSE,Skinny.  You’re in charge of supplies.  I’ll get you a list.
HANK,"Yeah, tell you what -- we’re gonna go peek our heads in, check it out. Stay here a minute."
SKYLER,#NAME?
WALT,"Look, if he didn’t give up my name while Hank was beating him senseless, he’s never going to talk."
JESSE,"We are who we are, Mr. White.  You know, two junkies with a duffel bag fulla cash?  Like you said, we both woulda been dead within a week."
JESSE,Sorry.  I-I just...
JESSE,"Jesus, Martin.  We’re only gonna be out there a couple days --"
WALT,It’s good to see you.
HANK,Nah.  I’m in this bed for a reason.
SKYLER,Thank you.
WALT,"You are paid extraordinarily well, why can’t you just appreciate that..."
WALT,“I’m in my own private domicile and I won’t be harassed!”
SKYLER,"Just kinda feels right, you know? It’s my new favorite."
WALT,Hey...
WALT,I got my old job back.
WALT,Sure.
JESSE,"Yeah, you know.  Just stuff gets spilled."
SKYLER,They’ll say they’re not denying coverage.
MARIE,"Oh, you’re Ted!  I’ve heard so much about you.  Thank you for your gift basket.  That was very thoughtful."
SKYLER,"I’m gonna make you a deal, Walt. I won’t tell Hank... or your children... or anybody else. Nobody will ever hear it from me. But only if you grant me this divorce and stay out of our lives."
MARIE,You afraid you’ll lose?
SAUL,"It’s the Tax Man.  And he’s looking at you.  Now what does he see?  He sees a young fella with a big fancy house, unlimited cash supply and no job.  Now what is the conclusion the Tax Man makes?"
SKYLER,What does that mean?  Negotiated.
JESSE,"What, like, my interesting life? Uh...  One day pretty much bleeds into the next."
HANK,Christian Ortega...
SKYLER,And that seafood table with the lobster tails and crab legs and oysters...
WALT,And I want my own key to the house.
SKYLER,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely, absolutely.  Fatten that baby up."
MARIE,"You know?  Screw it.  I’m gonna make sure he gets what he needs, they can just reimburse me later."
SAUL,"Okay.  Let me bottom line this for you.  You don’t need to be involved.  Okay?  Because I’ve been doing this for a lot of years, successfully -- believe it or not, without your help!"
SKYLER,"Honey, want another waffle..?"
JESSE,Jane’s dad.
GUS,Shake hands.
JESSE,How do you not hate yourself?
MARIE,"“Next week?”  Uh, no.  That’s not gonna do it.  I’ve looked into this, and the sooner physical therapy begins, the better his chances are, and..."
MARIE,#NAME?
HANK,You told me the kid was getting his doobage on.
WALT JR,Doesn’t matter if you voted for it. It’s the law.
WALT,"Well, maybe we could head up the Turquoise Trail.  Stop at Tinkertown, maybe grab lunch in Madrid --"
SKYLER,Please tell me you’re taking the money.
JESSE,What?
JESSE,"Like, hit bone."
SKYLER,Investment in what?
SKYLER,I think Marie should know the truth.
GUS,I have a very large investment in this.
JESSE,"What?  Yeah, yeah... He’s cool."
SKYLER,I’m perfectly capable of managing a small business --
GUS,I hope you like Paila Marina...
JESSE,What are you talking about?
JESSE,"Yo, does somebody got an axe I can use?"
JESSE,Dammit.
SAUL,"Ouch!  What was your mistake?  You didn’t launder your money.  Now, you give me your money -- that’s called placement.  Hand me that little thing..."
GUS,Good to see you again.
SAUL,Hey... there he is!  Finally!  I went ahead and started without you.
SKYLER,Four.
SKYLER,"You’ve got all these nice tulips there, and good baby’s breath..."
JESSE,I have a “Get-Outta-Jail Free” card.
SKYLER,Thank you.
JESSE,"Yo, I thought I was gonna see some, like, vaginas."
JESSE,I need your help.
WALT JR,They’re--pre--shrunk.
GUS,Then you have it.
SKYLER,"I don’t remember asking you, alright?  You wanna be supportive? Be supportive without all this prying, for god’s sake."
SKYLER,"Yeah, okay... um...  Last thing, and then I’ll let you go."
WALT,"Skyler, how do you think we’ve been paying our bills these last six months?"
MIKE,Shut up.  Shut up.  I can’t do it. I’m sorry.
WALT JR,"Mom... Mom, put it down."
JESSE,Okay.
HANK,"Baby, it wasn’t the right thing. It’s not what the job is.  I’m supposed to be better than that."
WALT JR,"Hey, Mom."
WALT,I would... say so.
WALT,No.
SKYLER,"Stop!  Oh, God... Please..."
WALT,Oh.  Water on Mars.
MARIE,Tricks.  It’s an expression.  How are you?
JESSE,"You like that?  Hurts, huh?"
HANK,How exactly that supposed to make me feel better?
HANK,No... I do.  I’m good...
MARIE,"Good.  Good.  Jesus, god knows I’m relieved..."
MARIE,And somebody bought it?
WALT,-- I said “maybe.”  Maybe bugged --
WALT JR,"Um.  Great dinner, Mom.  Um, Can I be, can I be excused?"
JESSE,"Yes!  Alright!  Livin’ large, playas!"
WALT,Let me understand this.  You’re turning down one and a half MILLION dollars? --
MARIE,He’s gone.
WALT,Hey.
SKYLER,"What?  No!  No-no-no, you should rest.  Look.  Why don’t you go in and take a long bath?  I put fresh sheets on the bed."
WALT,"Yes.  Now, it may sound unorthodox, but I think our first best option is... Jesse Pinkman."
JESSE,What about family?
JESSE,Anyway.  It’s better now.
JESSE,Hey!
HANK,"I’m not gonna bet on whether I can get a boner.  There’s no bet, no bet here!  No bet!"
WALT,We’ll discuss all of this later --
WALT JR,Seriously?  Wha-what kind of business?
JESSE,How’d you find me?
WALT,What are you doing?  What are you doing?
SAUL,I knew I could count on you boys to play nice.  That’s -- that almost brings a tear to my eye.
SKYLER,"Hi, you.  What’s going on?"
HANK,"Yeah, well, that’s not the rules."
SKYLER,I’m sorry...
WALT,What exactly is this?
MARIE,"Wow.  Out of the mouths of babes, huh?"
MIKE,I don’t know if it’s a barrel leak or what... but you got something mighty stinky down there.
SAUL,"Fair enough.  I’ll walk you through the process.  First step is something we like to call “money laundering.”  Alright, take you’re money were represented by say... these jelly beans."
SKYLER,I met my reserve and there’s still two minutes.
WALT JR,Thank you.  Please hand this to your car wash professional and have an A-1 day.
HANK,That’s the spirit! --
SAUL,"I can’t tell you, Mike.  Alright? I -- look.  If I was to tell you, well I just... I couldn’t live with myself.  I’m sorry."
WALT,Sure.
WALT,How about “fine”?
JESSE,It’s a REAL one.
GUS,Those men outside are my trusted employees.  And when I learned what you intended to do...
MIKE,Where is he right now?  You give me an address.
SKYLER,Are we safe?
HANK,"Um, do you -- do you have an RV?"
WALT,Absolutely not.  And I appreciate the offer.  But it turns out my insurance came through after all.
JESSE,Frickin’ PSYCHO!  AHH!
MARIE,"Wait till you see the bedroom.  I had ‘em move the plasma in.  I know that’s how you always wanted it -- you only had to get shot to get it, right?  I got you a new bed..."
MARIE,Want me to make you some breakfast?
JESSE,You heard me.  What kinda mom gets wasted with a little kid to take care of?
JESSE,What?
WALT,"He’s still my son.  I mean, he will remain --"
HANK,Yes.  Why?
SKYLER,Yeah.  Let’s sit.
JESSE,What?
SKYLER,So he wants to help -- why is that a bad thing?
JESSE,"Yeah, yeah..."
SKYLER,"Who is he?  What’s his name?  What are his qualifications?  Walt, this..."
HANK,Yes sir.
JESSE,"Hell, yeah I’m back!  With a vengeance!  Nigga gotta make a living!  And with your cousin gone away and all..."
WALT,"No, no this one’s fine."
HANK,How’d you do it?  Talk!  Who’re you working with?!
WALT JR,I dunno.
WALT JR,"Shit, come--on.  This is--the best-- Wait, wait..."
SKYLER,"I don’t care about that, Walt."
SKYLER,Sixteen years.
WALT,"I was at home and-and we needed diapers.  And, so I said I’d go, but it was just an excuse. Actually, that was the night I brought you your money.  Remember?"
SKYLER,"I just need you to mow at some point.  I’d do it myself, except it always throws rocks at me.  I think it needs a new bag."
SKYLER,Flynn...
WALT JR,It’s alright.
JESSE,“Perfect moment?”  For what --  to drop dead?
WALT JR,"""Hang in there! "" They said it too!"
SKYLER,"God, we haven’t been there in forever --"
WALT,Bins are packed?
MARIE,Hey.  How’d it go last night?
JESSE,I know.  I’m moving slowly.  Yeah. Absolutely.  I’m just gonna need your “swatter” thing...  Come on. Oh yeah.  It’s okay... come on.
WALT,Me?
JESSE,What do you mean?  How much have you sold?
SKYLER,"Well, he’s certainly a lot safer up here, isn’t he?"
SKYLER,So what?  We’re just supposed to compromise on his care?
JESSE,I found this stuff on the internet. Takes days to kick in.  Just keep quiet and this won’t ever come back to you.
GUS,If it wasn’t for this man -- and the respect I have for him -- I would be dealing with this in a very different way.
JESSE,"Yeah.  I’ve heard it... over and over and over again.  Y’know, don’t you think it’s ridiculous that society says beer is okay, and a little hit of something... sweet is wrong?"
WALT JR,Uncle Hank is dead?
